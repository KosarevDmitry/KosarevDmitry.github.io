I have 10+ years of experience with .NET.  
I can say that I know in full sense of this word, know from my point of view means to predict result  of unit test that presented in runtime,
to know all interface, public method and properties classes. And how it work under hood many various libraries.
I can more or less skillfully to write on C#.
Even I have learned, have read codebase of  net clients, runtime\src\libraries  it does matter mostly only for me. 

- I used have experience with  ASP.NET, MVC,WebAPI,Sharepoint and WPF. Winform - no, I did not used it.
	 Firstly I read code base of  runtime libraries such as TPL and other. I have read code bases of  net client of RabbitMQ, MonogoDb;
	 C# libraries of Aspnetcore, dotnet, MediatR, EFcore, dotnet, Serilog. As regards to SignalR, I sort out only with api of this lib.
	 I read  a little bit of Confluent kafka dotnet client. 
  In general, I understand C# stack more or less deeply.                                          
	 
   With  Azure SDK I have been sorting out presently.
   Aspire is well.
