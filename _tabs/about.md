These are notes, drafts that are more or less smoothed out for publication, which, by the way, is important to me.
When you write not only for yourself, you become more responsible about consistency  and clarity of expression,  and then it will be easier to use, to remember what I meant through several months.

The number of posts on the topic of programming leaves almost no chance that this article will be of any use.
They are secondary; most likely, these questions have already been covered many times on Quora, Stackoverflow, etc.
I also donâ€™t want to preface several lines of code with large comments.
So these are just rough drafts, installation instructions. I wrote them for myself before, now I will post them on the Internet.
