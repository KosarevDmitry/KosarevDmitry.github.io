1 . Age of Qualification â€” Q 

2. Age of Discretion = D (Q + 3) 

3. Age of Promotion = P (D + 7) 

4. Age of Responsibility = R (P + 5) 

5. Age of Authority = A (R + 3) 

6. Age of Achievement = AA (A + 7) 

7. Age of Distinction = DD (AA + 9) 

8. Age of Dignity = DDD (DD + 6) 

9. Age of Wisdom = W (DDD + 3) 

10. Age of Obstruction = 00 (W + 7) 

The above scale is governed by the numerical value of Q. Now, Q is to 
be understood as a technical term It does not mean that a man at Q knows 
anything of the business he will have to transact. Architects, for example, 
pass some form of examination but are seldom found to know anything useful 
at that point (or indeed any other point) in 102 their career. The term Q 
means the age at which a professional or business career begins, usually 
after an elaborate training that has proved profitable only to those paid 
for organizing it. It will be seen that if Q = 22, X will not reach 00 (the 
Age of Obstruction) until he is 72. So far as his own efficiency is 
concerned, there is no valid reason for replacing him until he is 71. But 
our problem centers not on him but on Y, his destined successor. How are the 
ages of X and Y likely to compare? To be more exact, how old will X have 
been when Y first entered the department or firm? 

This problem has been the subject of prolonged investigation. Our 
inquiries have tended to prove that the age gap between X and Y is exactly 
fifteen years. (It is not, we find, the normal practice for the son to 
succeed the father directly.) Taking this average of fifteen years, and 
assuming that Q = 22, we find that Y will have reached AA (the Age of 
Achievement) at 47, when X is only 62. And that, clearly, is where the 
crisis occurs. For Y, if thwarted in his ambition through X's still 
retaining control, enters, it has been proved, a different series of stages 
in his career. These stages are as follows:
