Team communication

We got together in the morning and discussed all the tasks that we have at that moment.
Each employee gave a short report.
In general, it was boring and useless, because what I was talking about was not
 interesting to my colleagues a priori, and I didn’t understand what they were talking about.
During the day we corresponded or called each other and only then could we find out anything.
I got the impression that the tester should have been involved from the beginning of the formulation of the problem.
Ultimately, it was the bureaucratic tasks that mattered. This is inevitable when so many people are involved in that type of work.
They need to do something. I really love Parkinson’s book and was convinced at meetings  that it is so, as Parkinson describes it.

Many are excellent programmers and generally pleasant guys to talk to.

I didn’t understand why you should make descriptions in html format in confluence if you can do it in json, or even better, right in the class in the models folder in the project. Select it into a separate project and share it. And let data analist write what is int and what is not.
