Mr. David Kimberly
Director General, Civil Aviation
Government of Seychelles
10 Island View Parkway
Seychelles

Dear David:

I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to you for your very active participation in our recent conference in Montreal on the "future of aviation". The Chairman and Board Members have also asked me to pass on their sincere appreciation for your efforts in supporting the Institute in this important undertaking.

Your skill in chairing the controversial panel on "The Role of Developing Countries in the Future of Aviation Management" was very much appreciated by those representing all sides of that extremely sensitive topic. As well, we have received numerous post-conference requests for the paper you delivered on "The Critical Issue of Cooperation Between Airlines and Airports." It appears that you may have penned a best-seller with that one!

On both a professional and a personal level, I really appreciated the time that the two of us were able to spend together for fun and reflection during conference down times. I certainly learned a lot about the unique aspects of aviation operations in your part of the world (not to mention the things you taught me about the backhand on the squash court!).

We are currently hard at work producing the "Compendium of Conference Proceedings" document, and we expect to be sending it out to all participants early in the new year.

Again, thanks so much for your enthusiastic participation in our conference. I have no doubt that it would not have been the success that it was without your presence.

Please keep in touch, and drop in and visit us whenever you are in this part of the world.

Very sincerely,


Peter Smithfield
President and CEO

Dear Mr. McNeill:

Re: Request To Expedite Payment - Contract PLC-09-17542

Due to circumstances beyond our control, we have been unable to complete the final delivery phase of the exterior wharf retaining wall under the above-noted contract. All work has been completed except for the installation of the tie-down anchors which have not yet been received from the manufacturer. These are expected to arrive within four weeks and we plan to install them as soon as we receive them.

In the meantime, we are experiencing a serious cash flow problem which is affecting our ability to complete a number of our other contracts; including the access road extension project (PLC- 10-21743). As you know, any delay in completion of the access road will have a negative impact on a number of other Phase 2 contracts.

We therefore request that you immediately release payment for the above-noted wharf retaining wall contract, subject to a 10% holdback to be payable on completion of the tie-down anchors. That arrangement will protect you while at the same time relieving the problems caused by our current cash flow difficulties.

Accordingly, please find attached an invoice for the final progress payment of $67,575 for contract PLC-09-17542.

If you have any questions at all please contact me immediately at 312-752-3479.

On behalf of our entire company I thank you in advance for your kind cooperation.

Sincerely,


Charles Strathem
Construction Contracts Manager

Ms. Margaret Campion
Director, Corporate Services
Riviera Industries Inc.
245 Dearborn Park Road
Chicago, Il 60610


Dear Ms. Campion:

It was a pleasure meeting you briefly at last week's Board of Trade event. It's amazing how small the world does seem sometimes, considering that we both earned our undergraduate degrees at U. of Kansas, even overlapping for one year! I suppose we were destined to eventually meet face-to-face.

I was fascinated by your synopsis of the history of Riviera Industries over the past, almost half-century. Clearly, your company has a rich corporate heritage and tradition. At the same time, the company has been blessed with a continuum of leaders of foresight and imagination who had the courage to change course at key points along the way so that the company could remain competitive and continue to lead its industry.

As I was mentioning to you, Final Edition Publications is a specialty publisher that focuses on corporate publications including annual reports, corporate profiles and corporate histories. We have been in business for over 15 years and during that time have grown from a two-person start-up, to a serious corporate publisher with over 100 employees. We have been contracted by over a dozen Fortune 500 companies to produce both annual and special occasion publications on their behalf.

After our chat at last week's meeting, it occurred to me that with Riviera approaching its 50th anniversary, it would be the perfect occasion to produce a Corporate History to celebrate your company's first half-century. It so happens, that these are exactly the types of corporate publications that we specialize in here at Final Edition. In fact, we have produced corporate histories for dozens of companies.

With Riviera's 50th just around the corner, I'm sure that you have been thinking about ways to make that anniversary a special one. Accordingly, I would very much like to meet with you and show you some of the corporate work we have done, and brief you further on our services. I have a strong feeling that what we offer at Final Edition might be just the kind of thing you've been looking for to celebrate Riviera's 50th.

Please feel free to call me at 745-2398 so that we can discuss this further. If I don't hear from you by the end of next week I will follow up with you and see if we can set up a meeting at your convenience.

Yours truly,


Raymond Gaudet
Manager, Corporate Programs

MEMORANDUM

DATE:  September 30, 20xx

FROM: Meridith Bronson

TO:       Franco Marconi, Director, Research Programs

SUBJECT: Commendation - Henry Stapleton - Transport Demand Project

The purpose of this is to officially commend Henry Stapleton for his exceptional contribution throughout his assignment to the Transport Demand Project (TDP).

As you know, Henry has been working on special assignment with the TDP team for the past eight months. Now that he is about to return to your part of the organization I wanted to make sure that he gets some recognition for his significant and exceptional contributions to the project.

As a junior econometrician, Henry's role in the project was pivotal to its timely and successful completion. It was Henry who worked long hours, numerous nights and weekends with his small team of researchers, first specifying, and then testing the thousands of equations that had to be run. The quality of Henry's written work was also exceptional. His regression analysis summaries were always very well written and rarely required revision.

As a colleague and project team member, Henry was also outstanding. His upbeat enthusiasm for the project was infectious, and he seemed to motivate the entire project team. He was very well-liked by all team members, and in effect he became "unofficial" deputy project manager.

In closing, I would like to say that I have worked with many junior economists and econometricians over the years and have never run across one as professional and productive as Henry Stapleton was on the TDP. I believe that the organization as a whole should recognize his exceptional contribution to a major project.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Mr. Alphonse Germanian
President and CEO
BioDynamics Llc.
1525 Broadway, Suite 4500
New York, NY 10034


Dear Mr. Germanian:

As Chairperson of the Corporate Conscience Campaign - Helping the Homeless in New York, I am writing this to thank you personally for your company's support in last month's fund-raising effort.

As I indicated when we spoke on the phone two weeks ago, the campaign was considered a resounding success, raising a total of $1.65 million to-date, significantly exceeding our target of $1 million. Some donations are still trickling in, so we could end up close to a total of $2 million.

BioDynamics was an influential leader throughout the entire three-month campaign. In fact, we couldn't have succeeded without the generous support of your company, both financially, and through your organizational and administrative assistance. Your Team Leader, Kathryn Gomez was particularly impressive, going above and beyond what we could have expected of someone performing as a volunteer while continuing on with her day-to-day duties. Please convey my special thanks to Kathryn.

I would also ask you to convey my sincere thanks and congratulations to all of those other people in your company who contributed in any way to the Helping the Homeless Campaign. Please tell them that the sum of their contributions resulted in a major success that they should all be proud of taking part in.

I believe that the 27 companies that participated in this effort have set a new standard for social responsibility in this community, and have set a powerful example that will inspire other companies and organizations to do the same.

I look forward to seeing you at the Mayor's special thank you reception next month.

Yours sincerely,


Jackson Pritchard
Fundraising Chair

Dear Belinda:

On behalf of everyone here at Deerwood Resorts Ltd., I would like to sincerely congratulate you on your recent graduation from Mountain State University with your M.B.A. (Marketing).

I must say that I was not surprised to read of your success in the newspaper. During your first of four summers as an employee at our Lakeland Family Resort I noted how bright you are and how you have a very quick mind for business. Combine those attributes with your relentless work ethic and commitment to quality customer service, and it is obvious that you have a wide-open future ahead of you. I can only hope that your experience working with us contributed in some small way to your success.

On behalf of the management and staff at Deerwood Resorts I wish you all the best in your future career and life endeavors, whatever they may be.

Vancouver, British Columbia
Canada V6C 2R6

Dear Mr. Rafael:

Re: Notice of Intent To Conduct An Audit

Further to our recent phone conversation, this is to formally advise you that the Olympic Construction Committee has decided to request an audit of the accounting practices of Jenson Structures Inc. The audit will commence immediately and will be performed on behalf of the OCC by Taylor & Hanson Auditing Services Inc. of Vancouver.

As you know, this audit was prompted by some serious invoice/work order discrepancies that were noted during a number of our transaction-sampling mini-audits that were conducted over the past six months. When briefed on the results of these mini-audits, the OCC decided that an immediate audit of Jenson’s accounting practices and procedures with respect to invoicing was warranted.

The audit will be conducted in full accordance with the OCC’s contract administration and control policy which is an addendum to all of our construction contracts. Among other things, that policy states that “…all outstanding invoices submitted by the company being audited will be held in abeyance until such time as the results of the audit are known.” Also in accordance with the policy, “… depending on the results of the audit, it will be at the Committee’s sole discretion to determine when, and to what degree, any payments will be made to cover any outstanding invoices.”

We look forward to your complete cooperation with the auditors so that the audit can be conducted quickly and concluded as soon as possible.

If you have any questions about the audit process please feel free to contact the Project Senior Auditor, Janice Gonzalez, at 604-459-4111.

Sincerely,


Gordon Cranston
Chairman, OCC Accountability Committee

North Bergen, NJ 07045

Dear Ms. Lambton:
Further to your telephone inquiry yesterday, enclosed is a copy of Merrick’s Annual Report for the 2009-2010 operating year.

As I mentioned, the financial results in terms of earnings per share need to be qualified as per the notes included on pages 28 and 29. As explained there, we had a number of extraordinary transactions last year which caused the earnings picture to appear understated in comparison with what we expect for this year. In fact, it is our firm expectation that this year’s per share earnings figures will be twice that of last year.

With respect to the numerous questions you had regarding our publishing operations, would you please have a look at the summary of operations on pages 31 to 33. There is plenty of specific detail there that will likely answer most of your questions. If you still have questions after reviewing that information, please feel free to give me a call at 250-235-9867. If I can’t answer your questions I will put you in touch with those who will be able to.

Thanks very much for your interest in Merrick Industries. If I don’t hear from you in the meantime, I look forward to getting your feedback at the November CFO Society meeting.

Yours sincerely,

Dear [Customer Name]:
Will You Join Me In Protecting Our Community?

I am sending this to you as a fellow member of the Pinewood Acres community. Like me, I'm sure that you value living in such a quiet and peaceful neighborhood.

You know, sometimes in order to keep one's community "quiet and peaceful" one has to take action. That's what this letter is all about - taking action - community action.

By now, via media reports and word of mouth you must be aware of the significant increase in house break-ins in this neighborhood over the past couple of years. In fact, the break-in rate has more than doubled over the past two years. According to the police this is just a sign of the times as the economic downturn continues and local businesses and factories continue to close their doors for good.

As you may know, a local Community Action Committee has been meeting over the past two months to try to find ways to reduce the break-in rate in Pinewood Acres. Last week they released their recommendations on how best to combat that problem. Their primary recommendation calls for increased police and security patrols to supplement the local Neighborhood Watch program. They estimate that the extra cost to double nighttime (after dark) security patrols by Secure Inc. will be in the range of $15,000 to $20,000 per year. Unfortunately, this amount is not included in this year's municipal budget allocation and there are no additional funds available.

Therefore, as a concerned member of this community I have decided that my business will take the lead in assisting with this year's security control budget. Accordingly, Branscombe's Hardare will donate $1 for every $2 raised in the community to cover the additional security costs.

I urge you to join me today in supporting this worthy cause for our common good. To make your donation today you can drop in to either one of our two stores and deposit your donation in the boxes provided near the front cashes. If you can't make it to the store, please send a check or money order, made out to "CAC Security Patrol" and mail it to the address listed above.

Together, we can make sure that Pinewood Acres remains "a better place to live".

Yours in community spirit,

Dear [Name of Contact]:

According to the experts, involving students in community volunteer activities is one of the most effective ways to engage them in something meaningful during their after school time. Our experience has shown this to be true; and that is why at Valleycrest H.S. we put a great deal of emphasis on our Students In Action (SIA) program which actively promotes student involvement in numerous volunteer activities throughout our community.

This letter is requesting your financial support for a very important annual SIA event.

Each year we hold a Volunteer Appreciation Night where we recognize and honor the many student volunteers who have served in our community during the past year. Those students have worked as volunteers in many different capacities from, serving meals to the homeless, to entertaining senior citizens in old-age care facilities, to running household errands for housebound seniors and citizens recovering from surgery. Theses are just a few examples of the many ways in which our SIA students have served our community over the past year.

Volunteer Appreciation Night is the one time during the year when we briefly put the spotlight on those doing the giving; as an expression of gratitude for their selflessness throughout the year.

Accordingly, we are requesting the financial assistance of [Company Name] to help cover the costs directly related to holding that event. Your contribution would be used to offset such costs as: room rental, DJ fees, food and drink, prizes, etc. An amount in the area of $xxx would be an appropriate contribution by your company. Any surplus funds remaining after all bills are paid will be donated to the [Name of Community] United Way fund.

Your support for this important annual event would be greatly appreciated by everyone involved.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, please contact [Contact Name] at 999-9999. Email inquiries can be sent to sia@valleyfieldhs.org.

Sincere regards,

The theme of this conference is "Disabling the Disability - Looking It Straight In the Eye".It will be held at the Mountainview Conference Facility, in Montpelier, Vermont from December 3 to 5, 20xx.

For you information, Susan Crutchlow of Taming the Environment will be the opening Keynote Speaker. The provisional title of her presentation is "The Disabled Environment - Can We Help It?".

We expect attendance this year to be the highest ever; in the area of 2,000 delegates and 150 speakers. This includes a large contingent from our new European Chapter that is based in Geneva.

I will call you in a week or so to follow up on this.

Dear Ms. Gonzalez:
Re: Commendation - Shannon Berloitz

The purpose of this letter is to formally and publicly commend Shannon Berloitz for the excellent service she provided to Target-Track Inc. throughout the ramp-up and launch of our new product line. In my opinion, the level of service that Ms. Berloitz extended to our company was far beyond our expectations.

I have never before written a letter like this on an entirely unsolicited basis. However, in this case I was so impressed by the support and service provided by Ms.Berloitz and her small team of marketing and communications specialists that I felt compelled to go on record with my praise. These people truly deserve it. In an era where exceptional one-to-one customer service excellence has virtually disappeared from our industry, the work that Shannon and her team did should be held up as an example for others to try to emulate.

What particularly impressed me about the level of service provided by Ms. Berloitz et al was that there were no additional financial rewards involved. It appears that it was simply the team's extraordinary commitment to excellence in customer service and support that motivated them to always go the extra mile. Their example even had a positive impact on the attitude and productivity of our own staff!

In closing, I believe that Shannon Berloitz and her team truly deserve to be congratulated and rewarded for providing customer service and support well beyond the expectations of our company on the Target-Track project.

Very sincerely,

Dear Professor Morrissey:

Please allow me to introduce the bearer of this letter, Ms. Catherine Nasslund. Catherine is the architect that I spoke to you about last week when we talked on the phone.

As I explained, I am working on a feasibility study for one of the university programs here in Montreal that is considering the development of an Executive Management Training Centre. Part of my study involves having to estimate the possible fit-up costs for the proposed new centre.

The client is intent on making sure they get a "state-of-the-art" executive training facility. Naturally I thought of my alma mater at the Ottawa U. Executive MBA Center, as the perfect example as to how it's done.

As we discussed, if you would be kind enough to have one of your staff members spend about one hour giving Catherine a tour of your facilities there, I would very much appreciate it. Catherine tells me that it is important that she take the tour when the classroom and case rooms will not be in use, since she will need to take various measurements.

As you suggested, Catherine contacted Sharon Hudson of your staff to make sure that she would be traveling there at a time when it would be possible to do everything she needs to do.

Thanks so much Professor Morrissey. I really appreciate your co-operation on this matter.

All the best,

Since being invited to address this exciting opportunity, our team members have collaborated to produce a preliminary plan that we believe will energize the neighborhood, strengthen the University community, and produce long-term benefits for the entire City of Columbus.

As you know, we are a team of professionals with a proven track record in this region that has the ability to successfully transform our plan into reality. Our team is comprised of members who have worked together on numerous successful projects. They have been assembled for this project because of the enormous trust and confidence thay have in one another. You can be assured that the lead partners in our group will manage the project closely and carefully, and accountability for results will never be delegated.

In the weeks ahead, we look forward to receiving comments from Campus Renaissance and the community at large about our preliminary proposal during the public consultation process. We understand that right now the plan is clearly a 'work in progress' which can only be improved by input from the various stakeholders who care the most about the area in question. We therefore look forward to using their input to develop a comprehensive integrated final development plan.

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to participate.

To Whom It May Concern:

RE: Customer Reference - Fairmont Litho Arts Inc.

I have been asked to write this letter of reference because our company will no longer be operating its printing plant that has served Fairmont Litho Arts Inc. for more than a decade.

Fairmont Litho Arts has been one of our top customers for the past 12 years. Accordingly, I have no hesitation in recommending them as a company with which to do business.

In addition to doing business with his company for many years, I have known the president and founder of Litho Arts, Glenn Ralston, for over 25 years. We were classmates and teammates at McGill University in the late 1970s. Knowing him for so long I am quite comfortable in vouching for him as a great individual as well as a concerned and active citizen in this community.

As far as a company to do business with, Fairmont Litho Arts Inc. is one of the best that we have ever dealt with. Its practice has always been to pay our printing invoices within the 30-day time limit. We did significant amounts of business, especially during the past 5 years, and I cannot recall a late-payment situation involving that company. Billing disputes were rare, and those only required some minor additional documentation for clarification and resolution.

Fairmont was one of the best companies that I have ever dealt with from a change-order and work scheduling perspective. We maintained close communication with the company's production people and they always kept us apprised of their upcoming workload. Thus, scheduling jobs on our presses was never a problem. In addition, Fairmont's graphics people always provided us with high quality finished artwork, and it was unusual for additional changes to be made after the plates had been produced.

Based on our experience, any printing company should be very pleased to be the one that Fairmont Litho Arts selects to do business with once we have closed our doors.

Sincerely,


Gordon Manning

Mr. Roberto Villas
Manager, Marketing Services
Allied Industries Inc.
110 Riverbend Drive, Suite 1550
Stamford, CT 06907

Dear Mr. Villas:

This is in response to your recent request for a letter of recommendation for Maria Fuentas who worked for me up until two years ago.

Maria Fuentas worked under my direct supervision at Johnson Technologies for a period of six years ending in October 20xx. During that period, I had the great pleasure of seeing her blossom from a junior marketing trainee at the beginning, into a fully functioning Marketing, Program Co-Ordinator, in her final two years with the company. That was the last position she held before moving on to a better career opportunity elsewhere.

Maria is a hard-working self-starter who invariably understands exactly what a project is all about from the outset, and how to get it done quickly and effectively. During her two years in the Marketing Co-Ordinator position, I cannot remember an instance in which she missed a major deadline. She often brought projects in below budget, and a few were even completed ahead of schedule.

Ms. Fuentas is a resourceful, creative, and solution-oriented person who was frequently able to come up with new and innovative approaches to her assigned projects. She functioned well as a team leader when required, and she also worked effectively as a team member under the direction of other team leaders.

On the interpersonal side, Maria has superior written and verbal communication skills. She gets along extremely well with staff under her supervision, as well as colleagues at her own level. She is highly respected, as both a person and a professional, by colleagues, employees, suppliers, and customers alike.

Two years ago, when Ms. Fuentas announced her resignation to take up a new position with a larger company, we were saddened to see her leave, although we wished her the greatest success in her new undertaking. Even now, two years after her departure, I can state that her presence, both as a person and as an exemplary employee, is still missed here.

In closing, as detailed above, based on my experience working with her, I can unreservedly recommend Maria Fuentas to you for any intermediate or senior marketing position. If you would like further elaboration, feel free to call me at (416) 765-4497.

Sincerely,


Robert Christenson
Director, Marketing and Sales

To Whom It May Concern:

RE: Employment Reference - Tony Rocco

This is to confirm that Tony Rocco worked under my direct supervision as an Insurance Sales Representative from August 20xx to October 20xx.

During this period Tony progressed from sales initiation trainee to fully certified sales representative by the time he left for another job.

I would say that Tony is a hard working individual who learns quickly. He is generally cooperative and can perform well as a member of a team, although he prefers to work independently. He communicates very well orally and is working hard to improve his writing skills. I saw considerable improvement in this area during the last year he was with us.

As a sales professional, Tony was always above the 50th percentile of performers on my sales team. Since he started from scratch only two years ago, and most of his colleagues were highly experienced with strong, established networks, I would say that Tony achieved a lot in his early years as a sales representative.

So, based on what I observed during my two years with Tony, I believe he has excellent potential to become a high-performing sales professional in the insurance business.

For further information, I can be reached at (514) 989-0779.

Sincerely,


Jannik Soberman
Director, Insurance Sales Operations

Mrs. Edith Hampton
4575 Village Drive
Seattle, WA 98105-5032


Dear Mrs. Hampton:

I was deeply saddened to learn of Frank's death and I would like to express my sincere sympathy to you and your family on behalf of the senior management team here at Interconnect Corp. Your husband was highly respected by managers and employees alike throughout the entire company. He was regarded as a visionary leader by anyone who ever worked with him.

Frank's contributions to this company during his 27 years of dedicated and selfless service were many and varied. In the early years he was a major part of our initial expansion overseas, and a number of the offices he set up in Europe are still operating very successfully. In recent years Frank was a key player in our transformation to full digital technology, a move which catapulted us into a leadership position in the industry. Believe me, his contributions to this company will not be forgotten.

Please accept my heartfelt condolences at this difficult time and I ask you to please pass these sentiments on to your children. Your husband was a remarkable man in many ways. Knowing him personally as I did for many years, I am well aware of the difference he made in the lives of many people, both here in the company, and in his private life. He will be missed by many.

With sincere sympathy,


Charles T. Simpson
President and CEO


(print Employee Letter of Termination on corporate letterhead)

CONFIDENTIAL
December 5, 20xx

Thomas Zatinski
795 Gilmour St.
Apt. 508
Chicago, IL, 60611

Dear Thomas:

It is with sincere regret that I must inform you that your employment at Addison Systems Inc. will be terminated as of Friday January 31, 20xx.

As you know, the Downsizing Task Force delivered their report to the executive committee in late October. Among the task force recommendations was the elimination of all temporary and contract positions. Since you occupy a temporary position, your position is automatically subject to the task force recommendations.

I would like to make it absolutely clear that in no way does your termination reflect that the company is in any way unhappy with your work performance over the past 18 months. In fact, you have been highly regarded as one of our most productive contract staffers. Unfortunately, you and the other non-permanent staff that are being let go are simply a reflection of the general economic downturn in the fiber-optics industry over the past year.

In an effort to try to reduce the impact of this termination, the company has worked out a severance arrangement that will give you one week's pay for each month you worked beyond 12 months. In your case, this will amount to six (6) weeks of severance pay. In addition, your medical and dental coverage will remain in effect until the end of the severance period. You will soon receive a letter from the Human Resources Department with all of the details on the severance package.

Thomas, given your qualifications and proven abilities, I am confident that you will be able to find another position in the relatively near future. If you would like, I would be pleased to write a recommendation letter for you, to help with your job search.

Sincerely,


Fred Shandling
Unit Manager
