There are 3 ways I look at this question:

As a corporate software engineer. In that role, I don’t talk about cost. I don’t know how they budget my team’s time. I talk about schedule and sometimes about level of effort.

However, I really dislike this part of being a software engineer, because my best estimation efforts are always wrong by a factor of 4, and that’s after I have multiplied them by a factor 4. Parkinson’s law: Work grows to fill the time allotted to it. In my case, it seems to grow to 4 times the time allotted to it. I always ask my boss to secretly (i.e. don’t tell me) my schedule by 4 and I will be on time. I had only one boss who listened to me in that regard. Best boss I ever had. Actually understood me and believed me. Worked out great.
As a contractor. I use the time/money rule from Nikolay Petrov's answer. So, I do my estimate as above. I multiply by 4. I round that up. I then charge that based upon how many weeks I estimated and what I want my labor rate to be. I end up under-charging by a factor of 4.

I am so glad I’m retired and take only “fun” or “educational” contracts and am not doing this for a living anymore. I would starve my whole family to death. When I was contracting for a living, I only took pay by the hour contracts and avoided this whole issue.
As an ISV (independent software vendor), i.e. as a company that has written software and now sells it (i.e. what my ex-partner and I did with Yacc++). Not on a contract basis, but as a product. I ignore all of the above and estimate what the software is likely to be worth to someone who would want to buy it. I use that to set what I consider a “fair price”. I don’t worry about what it cost to make it. I only worry about what it is reasonably (in my mind worth).

Yacc++ made my partner and I $1m, but over the course of 15 years (and for 2 people), so it was like a salary of $30k/year each. Fortunately, we were contract programming on a per hour basis also and did just fine because of that. Otherwise, we would have starved.
