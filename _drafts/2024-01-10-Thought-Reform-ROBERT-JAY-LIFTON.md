Now, after twenty-eight years, my own sense of this   
book has changed. I see it as less a specific record of   
Maoist China and more an exploration of what might be the most   
dangerous direction of the twentieth-century mind— the quest for   
absolute or "totalistic" belief systems.   
  
Indeed, that quest has produced nothing short of a worldwide   
epidemic of political and religious fundamentalism— of movements   
characterized by literalized embrace of sacred texts as containing   
absolute truth for all persons, and a mandate for militant, often vio-   
lent, measures taken against designated enemies of that truth or   
mere unbelievers. The epidemic includes fundamentalist versions of   
existing religions and political movements as well as newly emerging   
groups that may combine disparate ideological elements.   
  
These latter groups are often referred to as cults, now a somewhat   
pejorative designation, so that some observers prefer the term new   
religions. But I think we can speak of cults as groups with certain   
characteristics: first, a charismatic leader, who tends increasingly to   
become the object of worship in place of more general spiritual prin-   
ciples that are advocated; second, patterns of "thought reform" akin   
to those described in this volume, and especially in Chapter 22; and   
third, a tendency toward manipulation from above with considerable   
exploitation (economic, sexual, or other) of ordinary supplicants or   
recruits who bring their idealism from below.

Vili THOUGHT REFORM   
  
Indeed, this book is largely responsible for my having been drawn   
into these controversies. With the profusion of the religious cults   
during the late 1970s and 1980s, I began to hear that Chapter 22 was   
being made use of for various forms of "deprogramming" of cult   
recruits, and then that the same chapter was being studied by cult   
leaders, ostensibly for the purpose of dissociating their groups from   
the patterns I described. Young people who had been involved in   
cults and the parents of such people began to consult me about these   
general patterns. I felt I had to clarify my position by preparing a   
new essay on cult formation and totalism in my recent collection The   
Future of Immortality and Other Essays for a Nuclear Age (1987),   
but I have been especially pleased by the extent to which this earlier   
volume on thought reform has remained central to literature on cults   
and on totalism in general.   
  
Tendencies toward totalism in China itself have diminished over   
the years, as have specific thought reform programs. But that did not   
happen until after a fierce reassertion of totalistic behavior during   
the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and early   
1970s. I was able to study that upheaval and saw in it an effort on   
the part of the aging Mao Zedong to call forth the young in a com-   
mon quest to reassert the immortalizing power of the revolution it-   

----------------------- Page 6-----------------------

self, and hence I entitled the work Revolutionary Immortality: Mao   
Tse-Tung and the Chinese Revolution (1968). Chinese society is   
still recovering from that extreme, often violent, outbreak. The re-   
gime's subsequent tendency, through fits and starts, has been in the   
direction of liberalization throughout the society, but that in no way   
precludes the possibility of future waves of totalistic policies or   
thought reform projects.   
  
From the beginning, this book was meant to provide principles of   
a general kind, criteria for evaluating any environment in relation-   
ship to ideological totalism. Such patterns are all too readily em-   
braced by a great variety of groups, large and small, as a means of   
manipulating human beings, always in the name of a higher purpose.   
And it should not be forgotten that such groups can hold great attrac-   
tion for large numbers of people.   
  
In recent research on Nazi Germany I was able to explore the   
most sinister of all historical examples of this phenomenon. I found   
that a particular kind of totalistic ideology— a biologized view of   
society, or what I called a "biomedical vision"— could, with its ac-   
  
PREFACE ix   
  
companying institutions, draw very ordinary people into murderous   
activities. I came to understand that, in an atmosphere of totalism   
and brutality, even fragments of an ideology can readily contribute   
to participation in killing, as I reported in my book The Nazi Doc-   
tors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide (1986) . There   
are parallels in Nazi and Chinese Communist use of the idiom of   
disease and cure, as totalistic systems are apt to do; equally signifi-   
cant is the general contrast between Nazi cure by mass murder and   
Chinese Communist cure by "re-education."   
  
I have been equally concerned with a contemporary category of   
fundamentalism that could contribute to killing on so great a scale   
as to dwarf even what the Nazis did, that associated with nuclear   
threat. Nuclear fundamentalism can take shape around the weapons   
themselves: the exaggerated dependency on them and embrace of   
them to the point of near worship. That is what I call the ideology   
of nuclearism. The weapons become an ultimate truth in their os-   
tensible capacity to grant security and safety, to keep the world   
going, to offer salvation.   
  
A seemingly different but related form of nuclear fundamentalism   
is the "end-time" ideology, within which nuclear holocaust is viewed   
as the realization of biblical prophecy and a necessary occurrence to   
bring about the longed-for Second Coming of Jesus and eventual   
earthly paradise. In a study we have been conducting at The City   
University Center on Violence and Human Survival, we have been   
pleased to learn that even fundamentalists with strong belief in end-   
time ideas find it hard to espouse this formula without great ambiva-   
lence and uncertainty. They too, it seems, have taken in some of the   

----------------------- Page 7-----------------------

horrible actuality of the consequences of nuclear weapons and find   
it hard to believe that God would bring about such horrors or permit   
them to occur. Nonetheless, these fundamentalist attitudes become   
associated with the weapons in varying ways and with varying in-   
tensity throughout much of our society, and in the process they   
interfere greatly with the nuanced thought and moral imagination   
needed to cope with nuclear threat.   
  
While totalitarianism is a twentieth-century phenomenon requir-   
ing modem technology and communications networks, the totalistic   
cast of mind is not. It probably was, in fact, much more common in   
previous centuries. It is in any case part of the human repertoire, an   
ever-present potential that can readily manifest itself when historical   
  
X THOUGHT REFORM   
  
conditions call it forth. What is new is the potential for radically in-   
creased consequences of totalism, to the point of human extinction.   
  
The kind of wisdom that totalistic ideas now interfere with has to   
do with what I call species awareness and the species self, the recog-   
nition that, given the capacity of our weaponry to destroy all human   
life, each sense of self becomes bound up with the life of every other   
self on the planet. My critical evaluation of ideological totalism in   
this book is meant to further that species orientation.

PREFACE   
  
This study began as a psychiatric evaluation of Chi-   
nese Communist "thought reform," or "brainwash-   
ing." It is still primarily this; but it has also, inevitably, become a   
psychological study of extremism or totalism — and even more   
broadly, a study of the "closed" versus the "open" approaches to   
human change.   
  
It is based upon research which I conducted in Hong Kong in   
1954-55. It then evolved over four years of additional research and   
teaching in the United States. My work with Western and Chinese   
subjects — piecing together emotional details that were both poig-   
nant and extreme — and the psychological, moral, and historical   
challenge of the material have made this study an exceptionally ab-   
sorbing personal and professional experience.   
  
A book about extremism calls for a special measure of objectivity.   
This does not mean that its author can claim complete personal   
or moral detachment. The assumption of such detachment in psy-   
chological (or any other) work is at best self-deception, and at   

----------------------- Page 8-----------------------

worst a source of harmful distortion. And who during this era can   
pretend to be uninvolved in the issues of psychological coercion, of   
identity, and of ideology? Certainly not one who has felt impelled   
to study them at such length.   
  
Instead, I have attempted to be both reasonably dispassionate   
and responsibly committed: dispassionate in my efforts to stand   
away from the material far enough to probe the nature of the   
process, its effects upon people exposed to it, and some of the in-   
fluences affecting its practitioners; committed to my own analyses   
  
xi   
  
Xli THOUGHT REFORM   
  
and judgments within the limitations and the bias of my knowl-   
edge.   
  
Much in this book is highly critical of the particular aspect of   
Chinese Communism which it examines, but I have made no at-   
tempt to render a definitive verdict on this far-reaching revolution-   
ary movement. I am critical of thought reform's psychological   
tactics, not because they are Communist (or Chinese Communist),   
but because of their specific nature. In the last section of this book,   
these tactics are compared with practices within our own culture,   
which also receive critical treatment insofar as they resemble the   
ideological totalism of thought reform. Instead of contrasting the   
"good we" and the "bad they," rather, I have attempted to identify   
and understand a particular psychological phenomenon.   
  
In the pursuit of this understanding, I have recorded all that   
seemed relevant, including the details of whatever psychological   
and physical abuse my subjects encountered. I believe that this   
comprehensive approach offers the best means of contributing to   
general knowledge, and to the clarification of an emotionally loaded   
subject; and I hope that this study will thereby ultimately contribute   
to the resolution, rather than to the intensification, of cold war pas-   
sions. It is in fact one of the tragedies of the cold war that moral   
criticism of either side is immediately exploited by the other side in   
an exaggerated, one-dimensional fashion. One can never prevent this   
from happening; but one can at least express the spirit in which a   
work has been written.   
  
Such an approach requires that I inform the reader about my   
bias in both psychiatric and political matters. Psychiatrically, I have   
been strongly influenced by both neo-Freudian and Freudian cur-   
rents: the former through an association with the Washington   
School of Psychiatry during and immediately after the research   
study itself, and the latter through a subsequent candidacy in the   
Boston Psychoanalytic Institute. Both influences were also present   
in my earlier psychiatric residency training at the State University   
Medical Center of New York. I have found the theoretical writings   

----------------------- Page 9-----------------------

of Erik Erikson, especially those relating to questions of personal   
identity and ideology, particularly relevant for this study. At the same   
time, I have constantly groped for new ways to bring psychological   
insights to bear upon historical forces, and do so with a humanistic   
focus. Thus, I have made extensive use of my subjects' biographical   
  
PREFACE Xlii   
  
material, and have attempted to include in these presentations a   
flesh-and-bones description of their life histories in relationship to   
pertinent social historical currents, as well as a rigorous psychological   
analysis of their responses to thought reform. This seemed to me   
the best way to deal with the inseparable relationship between stress   
and response, and (in William James' phrase) to "convey truth."   
  
My political philosophical bias is toward a liberalism strongly   
critical of itself; and toward the kind of antitotalitarian (in the psy-   
chological terms of this study, antitotalistic), historically-minded   
questioning of the order of things expressed by Albert Camus in   
his brilliant philosophical essay, The Rebel. No one understood   
better than Camus the human issues involved in this book.   
  
I should like to mention a few of the many people whose direct   
personal assistance was indispensable to the completion of this   
study. David McK. Rioch lent initial support when support was   
most needed, and always continued to enrich the work through   
his urbane eclecticism, his provocative criticism, and his personal   
kindness. Erik Erikson, during many memorable talks at Stock-   
bridge and Cambridge, made stimulating and enlarging suggestions,   
both about specific case histories and problems of presentation.   
During the latter stages of the work, David Riesman offered gener-   
ously of his extraordinary intellectual breadth and his unique per-   
sonal capacity to evoke what is most creative within one. Carl Binger   
has been sage and always helpful in his advice. All four made   
thoughtful criticisms of the manuscript, as did Kenneth Keniston   
and F. C. Redlich. Others in psychiatry and related fields to whom   
I am indebted are Leslie Farber, Erich Lindemann, Margaret Mead,   
and Beata Rank. In the perilous subtleties of Chinese cultural,   
intellectual, and political history, I was constantly counseled by   
Benjamin Schwartz and by John Fairbank, both of whom read   
parts of the manuscript; and earlier in the work by Lu Pao-tung, Ma   
Meng, Howard Boorman, Conrad Brandt, and A. Doak Barnett.   
  
The literary advice and loving sustenance of my wife, Betty Jean   
Lifton, can hardly be documented. My father, Harold A. Lifton,   
also did much to encourage this study.   
  
The Hong Kong research was sponsored for the first seven months

by the Asia Foundation, and for the remaining year by the Wash-

ington School of Psychiatry. The manuscript was completed under   
grants from the Ford Foundation and the Foundation's Fund for   
Research in Psychiatry, both administered through Harvard Uni-   
versity.   
  
Finally, I must acknowledge my debt to the forty research sub-   
jects, Chinese and Western, whose personal thought reform ex -   
periences are the basis for this study. The extent of their intelligent   
collaboration in this work is apparent in the biographical chapters.   
In these, I have altered certain details in order to protect the sub-   
jects' anonymity; but none of these alterations affect t he essential   
psychological patterns.

CHAPTER   
  
WHAT IS "BRAINWASHING"?   
  
When confronted with the endless discussion on the   
general subject of "brainwashing," I am sometimes   
reminded of the Zen Buddhist maxim: "The more we talk about it,   
the less we understand it." The confusion begins with the word   
itself, so new and yet already so much a part of our everyday lan-   
guage. It was first used by an American journalist, Edward Hunter,   
as a translation of the colloquialism hsi nao (literally, "wash brain")   
which he quoted from Chinese informants who described its use   
following the Communist takeover. 1   
  
"Brainwashing" soon developed a life of its own. Originally used   
to describe Chinese indoctrination techniques, it was quickly ap-   
plied to Russian and Eastern European approaches, and then to   

----------------------- Page 11-----------------------

just about anything which the Communists did anywhere (as il -   
lustrated by the statement of a prominent American lady who,   
upon returning from a trip to Moscow, claimed that the Russians   
were "brainwashing" prospective mothers in order to prepare them   
for natural childbirth). Inevitably, the word made its appearance   
closer to home, sometimes with the saving grace of humor (New   
Yorker cartoons of children "brainwashing" parents, and wives   
"brainwashing" husbands), but on other occasions with a more   
vindictive tone — as when Southern segregationists accused all who   
favor racial equality (including the United States Supreme Court)   
of having been influenced by "left-wing brainwashing"; or equally   
  
3   
  
4 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
irresponsible usages by anti-fluoridation, anti-mental health legisla-   
tion, or anti-almost anything groups leveled against their real or   
fancied opponents.   
  
Then there is the lurid mythology which has grown up about it:   
the "mysterious oriental device," or the deliberate application of   
Pavlov's findings on dogs. There is also another kind of myth, the   
claim that there is no such thing, that it is all just the fantasy of   
American correspondents.   
  
Finally, there is the more responsible — even tortured — self-exami-   
nation which leads professional people to ask whether they in their   
own activities might not be guilty of "brainwashing": educators   
about their teaching, psychiatrists about their training and their   
psychotherapy, theologians about their own reform methods. Op-   
ponents of these activities, without any such agonizing scrutiny,   
can more glibly claim that they are "nothing but brainwashing."   
Others have seen "brainwashing" in American advertising, in large   
corporation training programs, in private preparatory schools, and   
in congressional investigations. These misgivings are not always   
without basis, and suggest that there is a continuity between our   
subject and many less extreme activities; but the matter is not clari-   
fied by promiscuous use of the term.   
  
Behind this web of semantic (and more than semantic) confusion   
lies an image of "brainwashing" as an all-powerful, irresistible, un-   
fathomable, and magical method of achieving total control over   
the human mind. It is of course none of these things, and this   
loose usage makes the word a rallying point for fear, resentment,   
urges toward submission, justification for failure, irresponsible ac-   
cusation, and for a wide gamut of emotional extremism. One may   
justly conclude that the term has a far from precise and a ques -   
tionable usefulness; one may even be tempted to forget about the   
whole subject and return to more constructive pursuits.   
  
Yet to do so would be to overlook one of the major problems of   

----------------------- Page 12-----------------------

our era — that of the psychology and the ethics of directed attempts   
at changing human beings. For despite the vicissitudes of brain-   
washing, the process which gave rise to the name is very much a   
reality: the official Chinese Communist program of szu-hsiang   
kai-tsao (variously translated as "ideological remolding," "ideolog-   
ical reform," or as we shall refer to it here, "thought reform") has   
in fact emerged as one of the most powerful efforts at human   
  
WHAT IS "BRAINWASHING"?   
  
manipulation ever undertaken. To be sure, such a program is by no   
means completely new: imposed dogmas, inquisitions, and mass   
conversion movements have existed in every country and during   
every historical epoch. But the Chinese Communists have brought   
to theirs a more organized, comprehensive, and deliberate — a more   
total — character, as well as a unique blend of energetic and in-   
genious psychological techniques.   
  
The Western world has heard mostly about "thought reform" as   
applied in a military setting: the synthetic bacteriological warfare   
confessions and the collaboration obtained from United Nations   
personnel during the Korean War. However, these were merely   
export versions of a thought reform program aimed, not primarily   
at Westerners, but at the Chinese people themselves, and vigorously   
applied in universities, schools, special "revolutionary colleges,"   
prisons, business and government offices, labor and peasant organ-   
izations. Thought reform combines this impressively widespread   
distribution with a focused emotional power. Not only does it reach   
one-fourth of the people of the world, but it seelcs to bring about in   
everyone it touches a significant personal upheaval.   
  
Whatever its setting, thought reform consists of two basic ele-   
ments: confession, the exposure and renunciation of past and pres-   
ent "evil"; and re-education, the remaking of a man in the Com-   
munist image. These elements are closely related and overlapping,   
since they both bring into play a series of pressures and appeals —   
intellectual, emotional, and physical — aimed at social control and   
individual change.   
  
The American press and public have been greatly concerned   
about this general subject, and rightly so. But too often the in-   
formation made available about it has been sensationalist in tone,   
distorted because of inadequate knowledge, or obscured by the   
strong emotions which the concept of brainwashing seems to arouse   
in everyone. Its aura of fear and mystery has been more conducive   
to polemic than to understanding.   
  
Still the vital questions continue to be asked: Can a man be made   
to change his beliefs? If a change does occur, how long will it last?   
How do the Chinese Communists obtain these strange confessions?   
Do people believe their own confessions, even when false? How   
successful is thought reform? Do Westerners and Chinese react   

----------------------- Page 13-----------------------

differently to it? Is there any defense against it? Is it related to   
  
6 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
psychotherapy? to religious conversion? Have the Chinese discov-   
ered new and obscure techniques? What has all this to do with   
Soviet Russia and international Communism? with Chinese cul-   
ture? How is it related to other mass movements or inquisitions,   
religious or political? What are the implications for education? For   
psychiatric and psychoanalytic training and practice? For religion?   
How can we recognize parallels to thought reform within our own   
culture, and what can we do about them?   
  
It was with these questions on my mind that I arrived in Hong   
Kong in late January, 1954. J 118 * a mont hs before, I had taken   
part in the psychiatric evaluation of repatriated American prisoners   
of war during the exchange operations in Korea known as Big   
Switch; I had then accompanied a group of these men on the   
troopship back to the United States. 2 From the repatriates' descrip-   
tions of what they had experienced, I pieced together a great deal   
of information about Chinese Communist confession and re-educa-   
tion techniques, and was convinced that this process raised some   
basic human issues; but the expediencies of the military situation   
made it difficult to study them with the necessary depth and   
thoroughness. I thought then that the most important questions   
might best be approached through work with people who had been   
"reformed" within China itself.   
  
Yet I had not come to Hong Kong with any clear intention of   
carrying out this detailed research. I had planned only a brief   
stopover on my way from Tokyo back to the United States after   
having lived in the Far East for almost two years, serving as an Air   
Force psychiatrist in Japan and Korea. But plans can be changed;   
and such change is sometimes an expression of an inner plan not   
yet consciously understood by the planner himself. Thus as long as   
I was in Hong Kong, I decided to make a few inquiries into a sub-   
ject that seemed so important.   
  
As soon as I did, I discovered that a number of Western scholars   
and diplomats there had also been asking themselves these ques-   
tions. They had been shocked by the effects of indoctrination pro-   
grams applied on the Chinese mainland. They told me of Western   
missionaries who, after having made lurid "espionage" confessions   
in prison, arrived in Hong Kong deeply confused about what they   
believed; of young Chinese students violating the most sacred pre-   
cepts of their culture by publicly denouncing their parents; of

distinguished mainland professors renouncing their "evil" past,   
even rewriting their academic books from a Marxist standpoint. My   
Western acquaintances had been both troubled and fascinated by   

----------------------- Page 14-----------------------

these events, and welcomed my interest in the problem. At my re-   
quest, they arranged for me to meet a few people like the ones they   
had described.   
  
The impact of these first encounters was not something one   
readily forgets: an elderly European Bishop leaning forward in his   
hospital bed, so deeply impressed with the power of the prison   
thought reform program he had just experienced that he could   
only denounce it as "an alliance with the demons"; a young Chi-   
nese girl, still shaken from the group hatred that had been turned   
upon her at a university in Peking, yet wondering if she had been   
"selfish" in leaving.   
  
I realized that these two people had both been through China's   
most elemental thought reform programs; and that these programs   
were much more powerful and comprehensive than the modifica-   
tions which had been applied to United Nations' troops in Korea.   
I also realized that Hong Kong offered a unique opportunity for   
the study of thought reform, although, surprisingly enough, no one   
was taking advantage of it. I sought a means of remaining there to   
undertake prolonged and systematic research into the process; and   
with the help of two research grants, my stay was extended into   
seventeen months of stimulating psychiatric investigation.   
  
CHAPTER   
  
RESEARCH IN HONG KONG   
  
Hong Kong was no ordinary setting for psychiatric   
research. Many problems arose, some of which I   
could anticipate, and others which I had to deal with as I went   
along, but all of which required approaches departing consider-   
ably from usual psychiatric protocol. The basic task was to locate   
people who had been put through intensive reform experiences   
and communicate with them in meaningful emotional depth. For   
I felt that this was the best way to study the psychological fea-   
tures and human effects of the reform process. I was not inves-   
tigating "mental disease" or patterns of neurosis; I was studying   
individual strengths, as well as vulnerabilities.   
  
I soon found out that those who had undergone this experience   
fell into two broad groups: Western civilians reformed in prisons,   
and Chinese intellectuals who had undergone their reform in uni-   
versities or in "revolutionary colleges." In both groups, it imme-   
diately became clear that intensive work with relatively few people   
was much more valuable than superficial contacts with many.   
Thought reform was a complex personal experience, destructive of   
personal trust; it took time for a subject — especially in an environ-   
ment as full of suspicion as Hong Kong — to trust me sufficiently   
to reveal inner feelings of which he was not necessarily proud. And   
with Chinese subjects this was intensified by the East Asian cultural   
pattern of saying (as both a form of propriety and a means of per-   

----------------------- Page 15-----------------------

  
8   
  
RESEARCH IN HONG KONG 9   
  
sonal protection) what one thinks the listener wishes to hear. For   
the first few sessions, Chinese were particularly likely to offer an   
elaboration of anti-Communist cliches; only weeks or months later   
would they reveal the true conflicts stimulated by Communist re-   
form.   
  
The twenty-five Westerners and fifteen Chinese subjects whom I   
interviewed all had experiences which came under the thought   
reform category. But I could not ignore differences in the two   
groups, both differences in the type of programs to which they had   
been exposed, and in their cultural and historical backgrounds.   
These differences were important factors in my conduct of the re-   
search and in the evaluation of the material, and I have also taken   
them into account in the book's organization: Part II deals only   
with Western subjects, Part III only with Chinese, and Part IV   
with a consideration of the basic problems raised by thought reform   
in general.   
  
Most Chinese subjects were more or less permanent residents of   
Hong Kong, having left mainland China for reasons often as-   
sociated with a negative response to thought reform. I was able to   
interview some very soon after their arrival, but the majority had   
come to Hong Kong a few years before (between 1948 and 1952)   
when the first great wave of thought reform was at its height,   
and it was still not too difficult for educated people to leave China.   
As refugee intellectuals, many supported themselves through work   
with press and publishing associations, while others received some   
form of aid from philanthropic and religious groups. I found it best   
to approach them, always indirectly and always by means of per-   
sonal introduction, through members of these various Hong Kong   
organizations. Work with Chinese subjects was invariably com-   
plicated — because of problems of language and culture, and be-   
cause of their difficult life situation (matters which will be dis-   
cussed more in Part III) — but at the same time it was extremely   
rewarding. Their life stories revealed much about the history of   
contemporary China, and their responses taught me a great deal   
about Chinese character, all of which was of vital importance for   
understanding thought reform itself. I was able to maintain rela-   
tionships with them over long periods of time, some for more than a   
year; I tried to see them frequently at first (two or three half-day or   
even full-day sessions per week) and then at weekly, bi-weekly, or   
  
lO THOUGHT REFORM   
  
monthly intervals. As I do not speak Chinese, it was necessary for   
me to use an interpreter with eleven of the fifteen subjects; the   
other four spoke fluent English because they had studied either in   

----------------------- Page 16-----------------------

the West or with Western teachers in China. I was surprised at the   
emotional depth that could be achieved in these three-way rela-   
tionships. Much depended on the intelligence and sensitivity of my   
two regular interpreters (one of them a Western-trained social   
scientist) and upon my developing with them an effective style of   
collaborative interviewing.   
  
The rhythms of work with Western subjects were entirely dif-   
ferent. For them, Hong Kong was not a home but an interlude.   
They would arrive fresh from a grueling prison ordeal, generally   
remain in the colony from one to four weeks, and then embark for   
Europe or America. Friends, professional associates, or consular   
officials would greet them and take care of them; confused as they   
usually were, they needed assistance. They were also fearful and   
suspicious, which made it necessary for me to approach them   
through the people in whom they had greatest confidence, and   
again on the basis of personal introductions. In order to be able to   
do this, I made myself and my work known among Western diplo-   
matic, religious, and business groups in Hong Kong. The arrival of a   
Westerner who had been a prisoner in China was always announced   
in the Hong Kong newspapers, and I was usually able to set up a   
first meeting almost immediately.   
  
My arrangements with all subjects were highly flexible, varying   
with the circumstances of each case. When possible, I had them   
come to my office-apartment; but it was frequently necessary for me   
to visit Westerners in homes or mission houses where they were   
staying, or in hospitals where they were convalescing. I insisted only   
upon the opportunity to conduct the interview in privacy; although   
even on this point I had to make one exception when a priest, be-   
cause of his fears, requested that a colleague remain in the room   
during our talks.   
  
I tried to spend as much time as possible with each Westerner   
during his brief stay in Hong Kong; but this time varied greatly,   
and depended upon the subject's availability, the special features of   
his case, and my own schedule at the time. Generally, once we had   
begun, the subject was as eager as I to work intensively together. I   
averaged a total of about fifteen to twenty hours with each; with   
  
RESEARCH IN HONG KONG 11   
  
some I spent moie than forty hours over several months, and in   
one or two cases, we had just a single interview. A session might   
last anywhere from one to three hours. Thus, a typical relationship   
with a Western subject consisted of eight or nine two-hour inter-   
views over a period of eighteen to twenty days.   
  
With most of the Westerners, communication was intense and   
intimate. Although the majority were Europeans, there was no lan-   
guage problem because English was the lingua franca for West-   
erners in China, and all of them spoke it fluently. Most were under   

----------------------- Page 17-----------------------

great inner pressure to talk about their experiences; they poured out   
their stories without hesitation, even if they withheld certain de-   
tails until later interviews. Some of them, as we shall see, were   
afraid of people, suspicious of me, or reluctant to reveal what they   
had done in prison; but in almost all cases, the need to unburden   
themselves overcame inhibiting factors.   
  
When I had introduced myself and told them a little about my   
research study (self-identification about profession and affiliations   
was extremely important in this environment), I would begin to   
ask them questions about their prison experience — if indeed, they   
had not already begun to tell me about it. I tried to cover this   
experience in great detail, at the same time following the general   
psychoanalytic principle of encouraging the subject to associate   
freely without interruption. What impressed me most about the   
material was its immediacy: just a matter of days from their reform   
ordeal, these men and women still carried with them its entire   
atmosphere. They had not yet had time to place any distance be-   
tween themselves and their experiences, or to initiate the distorting   
reconstructions which eventually occur after any stress situation.   
( I was to appreciate this immediacy more fully after I encountered   
such reconstructions during follow-up visits — Chapters 10-12 — with   
many of them in Europe and America three and four years later. )   
The freshness of the data was tremendously helpful in conveying   
the actual emotional currents of thought reform.   
  
Why did these subjects originally agree to see me? What was   
their incentive for taking part in the study? Many, who were in a   
rather confused state, seemed merely to be following the suggestions   
of people taking care of them. Some told me that they wanted to   
make a contribution to the systematic study of the thought reform   
problem, in order to help future victims, or to combat an evil.   
  
12 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
Others said quite frankly that they welcomed the chance to talk   
over their experiences with a professional person who had some   
knowledge of this subject, thus acknowledging their need for a   
greater understanding of their ordeals. Whether stated openly or   
not, this therapeutic factor became increasingly important with   
almost every Western subject (and with many Chinese as well)   
during the course of the interviews. Mostly I listened and wrote,   
but I did — when they expressed interest — discuss with them such   
things as mechanisms of guilt and shame, and problems of identity.   
They needed psychological support and understanding and I re-   
quired the data which they were able to supply: it was a fair ex-   
change. Most of them told me, before they left Hong Kong, that   
our interviews had been beneficial to them. Since they were so   
emotionally involved in the work, we were able to explore their past   
histories and their general psychological traits, and thus develop a   
dimension important to the study.   
  

----------------------- Page 18-----------------------

The Western subject group breaks down as follows: total —   
twenty-five; by profession — thirteen missionaries (twelve Catholic   
priests, one Protestant minister), four businessmen, two journalists,   
two physicians, one research scholar, one university professor, one   
sea captain and one housewife; by nationality — seven Germans,   
seven Frenchmen, five Americans, one Dutchman, one Belgian,   
one Canadian, one Italian, one Irishman and one (White) Rus-   
sian; by sex — twenty-three male and two female; by age — from   
twenty to seventy, most between thirty-five and fifty.   
  
In my interviews with subjects in both groups, I kept the follow-   
ing questions in mind: What was the nature of the process which he   
has experienced? What in his emotional responses did he share with   
the other subjects? How did he as a specific person respond to this   
process? What relationship did his character and his background   
have to his particular mode of response? I tried to avoid making   
premature generalizations and to remain open to the vast array of   
personal, cultural, and historical data with which I was confronted.   
  
I also made every effort to broaden my background information.   
In addition to the subjects themselves, I spoke to anyone I could   
find in Hong Kong (Chinese or Western) who had some knowl-   
edge of thought reform, whether as a scholar, diplomat, priest,   
former Communist, or simply from having observed people who   
had experienced it. And at the same time, I read everything avail-   
  
RESEARCH IN HONG KONG 13   
  
able about the subject; translations of the Chinese Communist   
press prepared by the American Consulate were especially valuable,   
as were additional translations which my interpreters made.   
  
As I proceeded with the work, I realized that one of the main   
causes for confusion about thought reform lay in the complexity of   
the process itself. Some people considered it a relentless means of   
undermining the human personality; others saw it as a profoundly   
"moral" — even religious — attempt to instill new ethics into the Chi-   
nese people. Both of these views were partly correct, and yet each,   
insofar as it ignored the other, was greatly misleading. For it was   
the combination of external force or coercion with an appeal to   
inner enthusiasm through evangelistic exhortation which gave   
thought reform its emotional scope and power. Coercion and break-   
down are, of course, more prominent in the prison and military   
programs, while exhortation and ethical appeal are especially   
stressed with the rest of the Chinese population; and it becomes   
extremely difficult to determine just where exhortation ends and   
coercion begins.   
  
I found it very important to consider what was behind thought   
reform, what impelled the Chinese Communists to carry out such   
extreme measures on such an extensive scale. The complexities of   
their motivations will be discussed later on; but it is necessary for   

----------------------- Page 19-----------------------

us now — before getting into the prison experiences of Westerners   
— to know something about the Chinese Communist philosophy or   
rationale for the program.   
  
Their leading political theorists, although reticent about tech-   
nical details, have written extensively on general principles. Mao   
Tse-tung himself, in a well-known speech originally delivered to   
party members in 1942, laid down the basic principles of punish-   
ment and cure which are always quoted by later writers. To over-   
come undesirable and "unorthodox" trends, he specified that   
  
. . . two principles must be observed. The first is, "punish the past   
to warn the future" and the second, "save men by curing their ills."   
Past errors must be exposed with no thought of personal feelings or   
face. We must use a scientific attitude to analyze and criticize what   
has been undesirable in the past . . . this is the meaning of "punish   
the past to warn the future." But our object in exposing errors and   
criticizing shortcomings is like that of a doctor in curing a disease. The   
entire purpose is to save the person, not to cure him to death. If a man   
has appendicitis, a doctor performs an operation and the man is saved   
  
14 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
... we cannot adopt a brash attitude toward diseases in thought and   
politics, but [must have] an attitude of "saving men by curing their   
diseases." 1   
  
The argument continues as follows: the "old society" in China   
(or any non-Communist society anywhere) was (and is) evil and   
corrupt; this is true because of the domination of the "exploiting   
classes" — the landowners and the capitalists or bourgeoisie; every-   
one has been exposed to this type of society and therefore retains   
from it "evil remnants" or "ideological poisons"; only thought   
reform can rid him of these and make him into a "new man" in a   
"new society." When this argument is applied to Chinese intel-   
lectuals, it is also pointed out that they originate from the "ex-   
ploiting classes" or from the closely related petite bourgeoisie,   
since only people from these classes had the means to acquire an   
education. And long philosophical treatises emphasize the need to   
bring the "ideology of all classes" into harmony with "objective   
material conditions" 2 — or in other words, to blend personal beliefs   
with Communist-implemented social realities.   
  
In prisons, Western civilians (and their Chinese cellmates) en-   
counter a special penal version of these principles:   
  
All crimes have definite sociological roots. The evil ideology and   
evil habits left behind by the old society, calling for the injuring of   
others for self-profit and seeking enjoyment without labor, still remain   
in the minds of some people to a marked degree. Thus if we are to   
wipe all crimes from their root, in addition to inflicting on the criminal   
the punishment due, we must also carry out various effective measures   

----------------------- Page 20-----------------------

to transform the various evil ideological conceptions in the minds of   
the people so that they may be educated and reformed into new   
  
Penal institutions are referred to as "re-education centers," "med-   
itation houses," or even "hospitals for ideological reform." Four   
types of institutions are described in Communist prison codes: 4   
the Detention House, the Prison, the Labor Service for Reform   
Corps, and the Juvenile Delinquents Institute. Westerners spend   
most of their time in the first, whose function it is "to assume re-   
sponsibility for understanding the conditions of criminals awaiting   
sentence." This means that the Westerners' one to five years of im-   
prisonment are essentially devoted to "solving their cases"; and they   
  
RESEARCH IN HONG KONG 15   
  
are not tried or sentenced until just before their release. Some have   
been sent to the second type, the prison proper, where they engage   
in various kinds of work. But the large-scale policy of "reform   
through labor" — the use of prisoners in labor battalions — has been   
mostly reserved for the Chinese themselves.   
  
In all of this it is most important to realize that what we see   
as a set of coercive maneuvers, the Chinese Communists view as   
a morally uplifting, harmonizing, and scientifically therapeutic ex-   
perience.   
  
After the Communist takeover in 1948-1949, there was a brief   
honeymoon period during which Westerners living in China were   
treated with great courtesy and encouraged to remain. Then the   
regime began to use the animosities aroused by the Korean war as   
well as a national policy of discrediting specific religious and edu-   
cational groups (and in fact of eliminating all non-Communist   
Western influence), to make it plain to Western Europeans and   
Americans that they were not welcome. Most left of their own   
accord, but others — held by a sense of missionary obligation or by   
special opportunity for business, scholarship, or adventure — chose   
to remain. A small number from this group were taken into custody.   
Most of the arrests occurred in 1951 during the national campaign   
for the "suppression of counterrevolutionaries," at which time ten-   
sions concerning "subversion" were very great. The Westerners   
were accused, usually on flimsy or even manufactured evidence, of   
dangerous "espionage" activities. And they were subjected, as few   
men have been, to a test of the durability of all that had gone into   
their sense of being.

CHAPTER   
  
RE-EDUCATION: DR. VINCENT   
  
I first heard of Dr. Charles Vincent through a news-   
paper article announcing his arrival in Hong Kong   
by ship after three and one-half years of imprisonment and twenty   
previous years of medical practice in China. I was put in touch with   
him through another subject of mine who had known him in the   
past. When I telephoned him at the boarding house where he was   
staying, he readily agreed to talk with me; but when I began to   
describe to him the location of my office, he showed some hesita-   
tion and then made it clear that he wanted me to come and pick   
him up. I consented to this arrangement and met him in the lobby   
of his rooming house just five days after he crossed the border. Dr.   
Vincent was a short, dark-complexioned, muscular Frenchman in   
his early fifties. He was not emaciated, but he did look pale; and in   
his eyes was that characteristic combination of fear and distance   
which has been aptly labeled "the thousand-mile stare."   
  
He said little during the brief automobile ride, but in response   
to my inquiries about how he was getting on in Hong Kong, he   
described feeling frightened and nervous. Upon entering my study,   
he sat down hesitantly, and listened without comment to my few   
sentences of explanation about my research. When I had finished,   
he looked at me directly for the first time and asked a quick series   
of questions: How old was I? How long had I been in Hong   
Kong doing this work? And then, with particular emphasis, "Are   
  
»9   
  
20 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
you standing on the 'people's side,' or on the 'imperialists' side'?"   
I told him I was part of the non-Communist world, but that I tried   
as much as possible to take no side in order to gain an understand-   
ing of the process of thought reform. He went on to explain that   
this was important because   

----------------------- Page 22-----------------------

  
From the imperialistic side we are not criminals; from the people's side   
we are criminals. If we look at this from the imperialists' side, re-   
education is a kind of compulsion. But if we look at it from the people's   
side, it is to die and be bom again.   
  
Having expressed both his fear and his dilemma — and indeed, the   
paradox of thought reform itself — he needed no more prompting to   
go into the details of his ordeal. I said little during this first three-   
hour interview, and not much more during the remaining fifteen   
hours (five additional meetings) which we spent together, for Dr.   
Vincent had a great need to talk about what he had been through,   
and he did so in an unusually vivid fashion.   
  
As one of the few remaining foreign physicians in Shanghai, he   
had been conducting a lucrative practice which included several   
Communist officials — until suddenly confronted on the street one   
afternoon by five men with revolvers. They produced a warrant for   
his arrest and took him to the "detention house" (or "re-education   
center") where he was to spend the next three and a half years.   
  
Interrogation and "Struggle"   
  
After a few preliminaries he was placed in a small (8' x 12') bare   
cell which already contained eight other prisoners, all of them   
Chinese. They were a specially selected group, each of them "ad-   
vanced" in his personal "reform," each eager to apply himself en-   
thusiastically to the reform of others as a means of gaining "merits"   
toward his own release. Their greeting was hardly a friendly one: the   
"cell chief" identified himself, and addressing Vincent in Chinese 1   
by his newly-acquired prison number, instructed him to sit in the   
center of the cell while the other prisoners formed a circle around   
him. Each in turn then shouted invectives at Vincent, denouncing   
him as an "imperialist" and a "spy," demanding that he "recognize"   
his "crimes" and "confess everything" to the "government." Vin-   
cent protested: He was not a spy. He was a doctor. He had worked   
  
re-education: dr. vincent 21   
  
as a doctor in China for twenty years. But this only resulted in more   
vehement accusations: "The government has all the proof. They   
have arrested you and the government never makes a mistake. You   
have not been arrested for nothing." Then his cellmates went on to   
question him further about all the activities in which he engaged as   
a physician to "cover up" his "spy personality." This procedure in   
the cell was known as a "struggle," conducted for the purpose of   
"helping" a prisoner with his "confession," and it was an experience   
which Vincent had to undergo frequently, particularly during the   
early phases of his imprisonment.   
  
After several hours of this disturbing treatment, Vincent was   
called for his first interrogation. He was taken to a small room with   

----------------------- Page 23-----------------------

three people in it: the interrogator or "judge," 2 an interpreter, and   
a secretary. The judge opened the session with a vague accusation   
and an emphatic demand: "You have committed crimes against   
the people, and you must now confess everything." Vincent's prot-   
estations of innocence were countered with the angry declaration:   
"The government never arrests an innocent man." The judge went   
on to ask a series of general questions concerning Vincent's activities,   
professional associations, organizational contacts, friends, and ac-   
quaintances during his entire twenty years in China. He answered   
these as accurately as he could, but was unable to satisfy his in-   
terrogator. The judge's demands always contained a tantalizing com-   
bination of hint, threat, and promise: "The government knows all   
about your crimes. That is why we arrested you. It is now up to   
you to confess everything to us, and in this way your case can be   
quickly solved and you will soon be released."   
  
After a few hours of this interrogation, questions began to focus   
more and more upon alleged connections with people from sev-   
eral groups: his own embassy, American government officials, and   
Catholic, Japanese, and Nationalist Chinese agencies. By 6 a.m.,   
after ten successive hours of interrogation, he had produced much   
information; but he still asserted his innocence, denied that he was   
a spy or had any subversive relationship with these organizations,   
and again said that he did not understand why he had been arrested.   
This angered the judge, who ordered handcuffs applied to Vincent's   
wrists, holding his arms behind his back. He dismissed the prisoner   
from the room, demanding that he "think over" his "crimes." But   
when he was returned ten minutes later, Vincent still stated that   
  
22 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
he could not recognize crimes of any kind. The judge again became   
incensed, ordered chains placed about Vincent's ankles, and sent   
him back to his cell. His return there was the occasion for continuous   
struggle and humiliation.   
  
When you get back with your chains, your cellmates receive you as   
an enemy. They start "struggling" to "help" you. The "struggle" goes   
on all day to 8 p.m. that night. You are obliged to stand with chains   
on your ankles and holding your hands behind your back. They don't   
assist you because you are too reactionary. . . . You eat as a dog does,   
with your mouth and teeth. You arrange the cup and bowl with your   
nose to try to absorb broth twice a day. If you have to make water they   
open your trousers and you make water in a little tin in the corner. . . .   
In the W.C. someone opens your trousers and after you are finished   
they clean you. You are never out of the chains. Nobody pays any at-   
tention to your hygiene. Nobody washes you. In the room they say   
you are in chains only because you are a reactionary. They continuously   
tell you that, if you confess all, you will be treated better.   
  
Toward the end of the second day, Vincent was concerned only   
with finding some relief ("You start to think, how to get rid of   

----------------------- Page 24-----------------------

these chains. You must get rid of the chains" 3 ). That night,   
when called for interrogation, he made what he called a "wild con-   
fession" — a description of espionage activities which he knew to be   
nonexistent. As he explained it:   
  
We see in the judge someone who wants to press something on us. And   
if we show we are a big criminal, maybe we will get better treatment.   
. . . Everyone of us tries to cheat the government this way. We know   
they are angry with the Americans ... so we become a member of an   
American spy ring ... I invented a whole organization.   
  
But when he was pressed for details, he could not substantiate his   
story, and inconsistencies appeared. The confession was rejected,   
and he was once more summarily dismissed by the judge. The round   
of interrogation and struggle continued.   
  
On the third night, he changed his tactics. Aware that the of-   
ficials were greatly interested in his activities and contacts, he be-   
gan to reconstruct and confess every detail of every conversation   
with friends and associates which he could remember from the whole   
of his twenty years in China. He did this because "I thought they   
were trying to prove I gave intelligence to friends."   
  
RE-EDUCATION: DR. VINCENT 23   
  
Now that he was talking freely, his captors began to press home   
their advantage. Interrogations, ever more demanding, took up the   
greater part of each night; these were interrupted every two or three   
hours for a rapid and painful promenade (in chains) which served   
to keep the prisoner awake, to increase his physical discomfort,   
and to give him a sense of movement ("in order to convince you   
to speed up your confession" ) . During the day, he was required to   
dictate to another prisoner everything he had confessed the night   
before, and anything additional he could think of. When he was   
not dictating the confessions or making new ones, he was being   
struggled. Every activity in the cell seemed to be centered around   
him and his confession. He soon realized that the cell chief was   
making daily reports to prison officials and receiving regular in-   
structions on how to deal with him. Everything he did or said —   
every word, movement, or expression — was noted and written down   
by other prisoners, then conveyed to the prison authorities.   
  
For eight days and nights, Vincent experienced this program of   
alternating struggle and interrogation, and was permitted no sleep   
at all.* Moreover, he was constantly told by his cellmates that he   
was completely responsible for his own plight. ("You want the   
chains! You want to be shot! .... Otherwise, you would be more   
'sincere' and the chains would not be necessary.") He found him-   
self in a Kafka-like maze of vague and yet damning accusations: he   
could neither understand exactly what he was guilty of ("recognize   
his crimes" ) nor could he in any way establish his innocence. Over-   
whelmed by fatigue, confusion, and helplessness, he ceased all re-   

----------------------- Page 25-----------------------

sistance.   
  
You are annihilated. . . . exhausted. . . . you can't control yourself,   
or remember what you said two minutes before. You feel that all is   
lost. . . . From that moment, the judge is the real master of you. You   
accept anything he says. When he asks how many 'intelligences' you   
gave to that person, you just put out a number in order to satisfy him.   
If he says, "Only those?," you say, "No, there are more." If he says, "One   
hundred," you say, "One hundred". . . . You do whatever they want.   
You don't pay any more attention to your life or to your handcuffed   
arms. You can't distinguish right from left. You just wonder when you   
will be shot — and begin to hope for the end of all this.   
  
A confession began to emerge which was still "wild" — full of   
exaggerations, distortions, and falsehoods — but at the same time   
  
24 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
closely related to real events and people in Vincent's life. Every   
night Vincent would sign a written statement of his newly con-   
fessed material with a thumbprint, as his hands were not free for   
writing. He was so compliant by this time that he made no attempt   
to check upon the accuracy of what he was signing.   
  
After three weeks, the emphasis again shifted; now he was re-   
quired to report on others, to make exhaustive lists of all of the   
people he had known in China, and to write out their addresses,   
their affiliations, and anything at all which he knew about their   
activities. Vincent complied, again supplying a mixture of truths,   
half-truths, and untruths. But after two weeks of this, under the   
continuing pressures of his captors, these descriptions became ex-   
poses and denunciations; friends, associates became drawn into the   
web. Still the clamor from the judge, officials, and cellmates was    
the same as it had been since the moment of imprisonment: "Con-   
fess! . . . Confess all! . . . You must be frank! . . . You must   
show your faith in the government! . . . Come clean! ... Be sin-   
cere! . . . Recognize your crimes! . . ."   
  
At this point — about two months from the date of his arrest —   
Vincent was considered to be ready for a beginning "recognition"   
of his "crimes." This required that he learn to look at himself from   
the "people's standpoint" — to accept the prevailing Communist   
definition of criminal behavior, including the principle that "the   
people's standpoint makes no distinction between news, informa-   
tion, and intelligence." He described two examples of this process:   
  
For instance, I was the family physician and friend of an American   
correspondent. We talked about many things, including the political   
situation. . . . The judge questioned me again and again about my   
relationship with this man. He asked me for details about everything   
we had talked about. ... I admitted that at the time of the "libera-   
tion," when I saw the horsedrawn artillery of the Communist army, I   

----------------------- Page 26-----------------------

told this to my American friend. . . . The judge shouted that this   
American was a spy who was collecting espionage material for his spy   
organization, and that I was guilty of supplying him with military in-   
telligence. ... At first I did not accept this, but soon I had to add it   
to my confession. . . . This is adopting the people's standpoint. . . .   
  
I knew a man who was friendly with an American military attache.   
I told him the price of shoes and that I couldn't buy gasoline for my   
car. I had already agreed that this was economic intelligence. So I wrote   
that I gave economic intelligence to this man. But they made it clear that   
I must say that I received an espionage mission from the American mili-   
  
re-education: dr. vincent 25   
  
tary attache through the other person, to collect economic intelligence.   
. . . This was the people's standpoint.   
  
"Leniency" and "Study"   
  
Just as Vincent was beginning to express himself from the   
"people's standpoint" — but in a dazed, compliant, and unenthu-   
siastic manner — he was suddenly surprised by a remarkable improve-   
ment in his status: the handcuffs and chains were removed, he was   
permitted to be comfortably seated when talking to the judge, and   
he was in turn addressed in friendly tones. He was told that the   
government regretted that he had been having such a difficult   
time, that it really wanted only to help him, and that in accordance   
with its "lenient policy" it would certainly treat him kindly and   
soon release him — if only he would make an absolutely complete   
confession, and then work hard to "reform" himself. And to help   
things along, pressures were diminished, and he was permitted more   
rest. This abrupt reversal in attitude had a profound effect upon   
Vincent: for the first time he had been treated with human con-   
sideration, the chains were gone, he could see a possible solution   
ahead, there was hope for the future.   
  
Now he was offered more friendly "guidance" in rewriting (not   
once but many times) his entire confession, including descriptions   
and denunciations of other people; and his change of fortune gave   
him added incentive in applying himself to the task. But he soon   
found that this guidance was not to be taken lightly, and on three   
occasions when he expressed some measure of resistance, saying,   
"This I didn't do," the chains were reapplied for two or three days,   
accompanied by a return to the harsh treatment of previous weeks.   
  
Once "leniency" had been initiated, however, Vincent was never   
again to experience anything as overwhelming as the assaults of   
his early prison period. Given the luxury of eight hours of sleep   
a night, of relatively calm and restrained interrogations (he was even   
permitted to sit on a chair), of practically no harassment in the   
cell, Vincent spent the next two or three weeks doing nothing but   
developing in even greater detail his confession material. During   

----------------------- Page 27-----------------------

his sessions with the judge, he received further instructions upon   
the proper way to apply the "people's standpoint" to all that he was   
writing and saying.   
  
26 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
Meanwhile, he was initiated into the regular cell routine: care-   
fully regimented arrangements for sleeping and awakening, for eat-   
ing and for relieving oneself. Freed of the chains, he could join the   
others on the two daily excursions to the toilet (everyone running   
head down, to an area with two open toilets, each permitted about   
forty-five seconds to attend to his needs with sharp criticism directed   
at anyone who took longer than this), and in the use of the urine   
bucket in the cell. He was still addressed only by prison number   
and continued to receive food adequate for survival but poor in   
quality. And the sores and infections caused by his chains and hand-   
cuffs were given more attention, including local applications and   
penicillin injections.   
  
Then, three weeks after the beginning of "leniency," he began   
to take part in the cell's organized "re-education" procedures. This   
meant active involvement in the group study program — the hsiieh   
hsi — whose sessions took up almost the entire waking existence of   
the prisoners, ten to sixteen hours a day. Led by the cell chief, its   
procedure was simple enough: one prisoner read material from a   
Communist newspaper, book, or pamphlet; and then each in turn   
was expected to express his own opinion and to criticize the views   
of others. Everyone was required to participate actively, and anyone   
who did not was severely criticized. Each had to learn to express   
himself from the "correct" or "people's standpoint" — applied not   
only to personal actions, but to political, social, and ethical issues.   
With each of the prisoners feeling that his freedom or even his   
life might be at stake, the zeal of the participants was overwhelming.   
  
For a long time after Dr. Vincent joined the group (and probably   
because of his presence), discussions centered upon past Western in-   
sults to China: territorial aggrandizement, infringements upon sov-   
ereignty, special privileges demanded for Western nationals. And   
the message was conveyed to him personally that "under the cloak   
of medicine" he was nothing but a representative of "exploitation,"   
an agent of the "imperialists," a life-long "spy," whose actions were   
from the beginning "harmful to the Chinese people."   
  
Discussions starting at an intellectual level would quickly become   
concerned with personal analysis and criticism. When Dr. Vincent   
was found wanting in his adoption of the "people's standpoint"   
or when his views were considered "erroneous," it became necessary   
for him to "examine himself" and look into the causes of these "re-   
  
RE-EDUCATION: DR. VINCENT 27   
  
actionary" tendencies. He had to search out the harmful "bourgeois"   

----------------------- Page 28-----------------------

and "imperialistic" influences from his past for further evaluation   
and self-criticism. Every "question" or "problem" had to be   
"solved," according to the "facts," in order to get to the "truth,"   
viewing everything, of course, from the "people's standpoint."   
  
Special "movements" would take place, jolting the prisoners from   
the ordinary routine into renewed emotional efforts. Sometimes   
these were part of broad, all-China campaigns, sometimes related   
to national prison movements, and sometimes locally initiated; but   
whether directed at "thought attitude," prison discipline, hygiene   
problems, or personal confessions, they always served to plunge   
each prisoner into a more thorough and compelling self-examina-   
tion. Everyone was intent upon demonstrating his own "reform"   
and "progressive viewpoint." The atmosphere came to resemble that   
of a great moral crusade.   
  
Dr. Vincent was still receiving more personal attention than   
anyone else in the cell. At first he simply gave lip-service to what   
he knew to be the "correct" point of view, but over a period of   
weeks and months, he began to accept these judgments inwardly,   
and to apply them to himself.   
  
In the cell, you work in order to recognize your crimes. . . . They   
make you understand your crimes are very heavy. You did harm to the   
Chinese people. You are really a spy, and all the punishment you re-   
ceived was your own fault. ... In the cell, twelve hours a day, you   
talk and talk — you have to take part — you must discuss yourself, criti-   
cize, inspect yourself, denounce your thought. Little by little you start   
to admit something, and look to yourself only using the "people's   
judgment."    
  
At times, the prison would take on a highly academic atmosphere.   
Vincent and his fellow prisoners would focus their attention on   
applying Marxist theory to Chinese and international problems;   
prisoners would be referred to as "schoolmates," prison officials   
would be called "instructors," and all would emphasize that only   
"discussion" and "persuasion" should be used to teach the ignorant.   
As Vincent became more and more involved in the process, he   
began to experience its impact.   
  
They put in evidence, in a compulsory way, the progress of the peo-   
ple. The people have a future. The theories of Marx about history teach   
  
28 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
us that imperialism is condemned to be destroyed. . . . They put in   
evidence all the examples of repression by the imperialists in China,   
the missions, their charity, helping landlords, helping the KMT [Kuo-   
mintang, or Nationalist Party] — all against the people. . . . They put   
in evidence the development of the Soviet Union — its industries, re-   
education, culture, uplifting of the people, the friendly help of the Soviet   
to China. They told us of the victory against imperialism in the Korean   

----------------------- Page 29-----------------------

war, the gradual remolding of Chinese society, the three- and five-year   
plans in order to arrive at socialist society, the transformation of agri-   
culture, the development of heavy industries, military improvement to   
defend the people, peace movement. . . . Living conditions of the   
Soviet state are very high; we see it in the movies, magazines, newspa-   
pers. We see the better condition of Chinese people in comparison   
with pre-liberation times — the hygiene movement in China, the cultural,   
the economic movement, the rights for minorities, rights between man   
and woman, free elections, the difference between freedom in the so-   
cialist and the imperialist worlds. . . . They solve every problem   
through discussion — the Korean war, the Indo-Chinese war. . . . They   
never use force; every question is solved through conference.   
  
But always, the emphasis would shift back to the individual   
emotional experience — to the "thought problems" which prevented   
prisoners from making progress. Dr. Vincent learned to express   
"spontaneously" all of his reactions and attitudes during the dis-   
cussions and especially to bring out his "wrong thoughts." And as he   
did so, he became ever more enmeshed in the special problem-solv-   
ing techniques of this ideological world.   
  
You have to get rid of and denounce all your imperialist thoughts,   
and you must criticize all of your own thoughts, guided by the official.   
If not, they will have someone else solve your problem and criticize   
you more profoundly. . . . You have a problem — you have to de-   
nounce it — a schoolmate has to help you — his help has to have "proper   
standpoint" .... I am quiet — they say, "You have a problem"; I say,   
"I wonder why the Chinese didn't confiscate all of the capitalist proper-   
ties like the Soviets. I think it might be better to do it like the Russians   
— this is my problem." They have schoolmates to solve my problem, to   
demonstrate I am on the wrong side because the Chinese Communists   
have to proceed in another way. Their way is reform rather than com-   
pulsion. He demonstrates that the Soviet revolution was different from   
the Chinese revolution — that the Chinese capitalist suffered through   
the imperialists because we imperialists never gave them the opportu-   
nity to develop their industries. Now the Chinese capitalists have to be   
useful to the Chinese government and undergo reform. If they follow   
  
RE-EDUCATION: DR. VINCENT 29   
  
the government they will have a bright future. . . , They have to ex-   
plain the facts until I am convinced. If I am not convinced I must say   
I don't understand, and they bring new facts. If I am still not satisfied,   
I have the right to call an inspector — but I wouldn't, I would just ac-   
cept, otherwise there might be a struggle. . . . You are all day under   
the compulsion of denouncing your thoughts and solving your prob-   
lems. . . . You understand the truth of the people — day by day, mo-   
ment by moment — and you cannot escape, because from your external   
manifestation they say they can understand your internal situation. If   
you continually denounce your thoughts, you can be happy denouncing   
yourself. You are not resisting. But they keep a record, and after one   
week if you are not saying anything, they tell you you are resisting   

----------------------- Page 30-----------------------

your re-education. ... If you think out five or six problems it is a   
good manifestation; you are progressing because you like to discuss   
your imperialist thoughts. This is necessary, because if you don't get rid   
of these thoughts, you can't put in new ones.   
  
When Vincent was too quiet and did not produce enough "wrong   
thoughts," he was criticized for not being "sincere" — for not tak-   
ing an active enough part in thought reform. When his views   
showed the slightest deviation from Communist orthodoxy, he was   
told that he was "too subjective," "individualistic," or that he re-   
tained "imperialist attitudes." When it was felt that he was not   
wholeheartedly involved in his reform — but was merely going   
through the motions — he was accused of "spreading a smoke-   
screen," "window dressing," "finding a loophole," or "failing to com-   
bine theory with practice." And after a while he followed the others'   
lead in seeking out these faults in himself through self-criticism,   
and analyzing their cause and their significance.   
  
A portion of the study hours each day were devoted to "daily-   
life criticisms": general conduct, attitudes toward others, willing-   
ness to do one's share of work in the cell, eating and sleeping habits.   
Where Vincent was found wanting in any of these, this was at-   
tributed to "imperialist" or "bourgeois" greed and exploitation, in   
contrast to the "people's attitude" of sharing and co-operation.   
When considered lax in his work, he was criticized for lacking the   
"correct labor point of view"; when he dropped a plate, this was   
wasting the people's money; if he drank too much water, this   
was "draining the blood of the people"; if he took up too much   
room while sleeping, this was "imperialistic expansion."   
  
Vincent would still hear talk of men who were shot because   
  
30 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
"they resisted"; and on the other hand he heard of the "bright fu-   
ture" — early release or happy existence in China — for those who   
"accepted their re-education."   
  
Advanced Standing   
  
After more than a year of this continuous "re-education," Vin-   
cent was again subjected to a series of interrogations aimed at once   
more reconstructing his confession — "because after one year the   
government hopes you understand a little better your crimes." Now   
from among the great mass of material which he had already pro-   
duced, the judge focused upon a few selected points, all of which   
had some relationship to actual events. And thus, "from a wild   
confession, you go to a more concrete confession." Then, eight   
"crimes" emerged — including membership in a right-wing French   
political organization, several forms of "espionage" and "intelli-   
gence" in association with American, Catholic, and other "reac-   
tionary" groups, other anti-Communist activities, and "slanderous   

----------------------- Page 31-----------------------

insults to the Chinese people." But now Vincent was more deeply   
immersed in the "people's standpoint," and the confession had a   
much greater sense of reality for him than before.   
  
You have the feeling that you look to yourself on the people's side, and   
that you are a criminal. Not all of the time — but moments — you think   
they are right. "I did this, I am a criminal." If you doubt, you keep it   
to yourself. Because if you admit the doubt you will be "struggled" and   
lose the progress you have made. ... In this way they built up a   
spy mentality. . . . They built up a criminal. . . . Then your inven-   
tion becomes a reality. . . . You feel guilty, because all of the time   
you have to look at yourself from the people's standpoint, and the more   
deeply you go into the people's standpoint, the more you recognize   
your crimes.   
  
And at this point he began, in the "correct" manner, to relate   
his own sense of guilt to the Communist world view:   
  
They taught us what it means to be a capitalist .... to enslave and   
exploit the people so that a small group of persons can enjoy life at the   
expense of the masses, their capital coming from the blood of the peo-   
ple, not from labor .... that all property comes from the blood of   
the peasant .... that we helped this bad policy, that our mind is the   
capitalistic mind .... and in our profession we exploited everyone.   
We used our profession to exploit people, as we can see from our crimes.   
  
RE-EDUCATION: DR. VINCENT 31   
  
Then came another fourteen months of full-time re-education.   
Vincent continued to concentrate upon applying Communist theory   
to his personal situation, demonstrating an ever-expanding "recogni-   
tion" of his "crimes."   
  
After two years, in order to show that you are more on the people's   
side, you increase your crimes. ... I said I wasn't frank before, there   
were really more intelligences. . . . This is a good point. It means that   
you are analyzing your crimes. ... It means that you realize your   
crimes are very big, and that you are not afraid to denounce yourself   
.... that you trust the people, trust your re-education, and that you   
like to be reformed.   
  
By this time his activities were no longer limited to his own case;   
he had by now become active — and skillful — in criticizing others,   
"helping" them to make progress in confession and reform. He had   
become an experienced prisoner, and was beginning to be looked   
upon as a true progressive. He even came to believe a great deal of   
what he was expressing — although not in a simple manner:   
  
You begin to believe all this, but it is a special kind of belief. You are   
not absolutely convinced, but you accept it — in order to avoid trouble   
— because every time you don't agree, trouble starts again.   
  

----------------------- Page 32-----------------------

During his third year of imprisonment, he was once more called   
in for a revision of his confession. The document became even more   
brief, concrete, "logical," and convincing. Now Vincent began to   
think of his sentence, estimating it from the "people's standpoint"   
which had become so much a part of him.   
  
You have the feeling that your sentence is coming and that you will   
be sent somewhere else .... and you are waiting. . . . You think,   
"How long — maybe twenty, twenty-five years" .... You will be sent   
to reform through labor ... to a factory or to a field. . . . They are   
very generous about this. . . . The government is very generous. The   
people are very generous. . . . Now you know that you cannot be shot.   
. . . But you are thinking that your crimes are very heavy.   
  
Now Vincent was told that his "attitude" had greatly improved.   
He was transferred to a different wing of the prison — and given   
treasured privileges, such as an hour of outdoor exercise a day and   
additional recreation periods in the cell. He found himself living   
in harmony with his captors, and during the last few months of   
  
32 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
his imprisonment was even permitted to give French lessons to   
other prisoners and to conduct medical classes for students brought   
to the prison for this purpose. All of this was not without its ef-   
fect:   
  
They used this as a premium in order to show me that they weren't   
against my work or my profession, but were only against my reactionary   
mind. To show that my work was well accepted, that they accepted   
my theories. ... To show what it means to live among the people,   
if I become one of the people. ... To put in my mind that life among   
the people is good.   
  
Soon he was called in for a formal signing of his confession — both   
a French version in his own handwriting, and a Chinese translation.   
Photographers and moving-picture cameramen were on hand, and   
he also read it for sound recording. With many others like it, it   
was widely disseminated throughout China and other parts of the   
world. A short time later he was called before the judge, and after   
three years of "solving" his case, he was read both the charges and   
the sentence: for "espionage" and other "crimes" against the people,   
three years of imprisonment — this considered to be already served.   
He was expelled immediately from China, and within two days, he   
was on a British ship heading for Hong Kong.   
  
Freedom   
  
From his story, Dr. Vincent might appear to be a highly success-   
ful product of thought reform. But when I saw him in Hong Kong,   
the issue was much more in doubt. He was a man in limbo, caught   
between the two worlds.   

----------------------- Page 33-----------------------

  
In his confusion and fear he felt that he was being constantly   
observed and manipulated. Much of this paranoid content was an   
internal extension of his prison environment:   
  
I have a certain idea that someone is spying on me — an imperialist   
spying on me because I came from the Communist world — interested   
to look and see what I think. . . . When I am doing something I feel   
someone is looking at me — because from external manifestation he is   
anxious to look at what is going on inside of me. We were trained this   
way in our re-education.   
  
And thinking out loud about me, he said:   
  
HE-EDUCATION: DR. VINCENT 33   
  
I have a feeling he is not just a doctor. He is connected with some   
imperialist organization which will bring me danger. ... I think   
maybe someone else is telling you the questions to ask me. . . . But I   
give you everything, and if tomorrow something happens, I could say,   
"This is the truth. I have endeavored to tell the truth."   
  
He expressed distrust toward the friend who had arranged for him   
to see me:   
  
I opened myself with him and told him my ideas. But then I thought,   
perhaps he will use this against me. We were both re-educated, taught   
to denounce everybody and not to trust anybody, that it is your duty   
to denounce.   
  
He later explained the reason for his request that I pick him up   
at his boarding house:   
  
When you telephoned me ... I thought maybe he is a Communist.   
. . . Perhaps an enemy. ... I refused to come here alone, because I   
didn't have a witness. . . . This way you come, you are seen, and if   
I disappear there is a witness.   
  
In this borderline psychotic state, Vincent graphically described   
his split identity:   
  
When I left China I had this strange feeling: Now I am going to the   
imperialistic world. No one will take care of me. I'll be unemployed   
and lost. . . . Everyone will look at me as a criminal. . . . Still, I   
thought, there is a Communist Party in my country. I am coming out   
of a Communist world; they must know I have had reform training.   
Perhaps they will be interested in keeping me. Maybe they can help   
me, and I will not be really lost. I will go to the Communists, tell them   
where I came from, and I'll have a future. . . .   
  
But when I came to Hong Kong, the situation changed completely.   
The Consulate sent a man right away on board with a special motor-   

----------------------- Page 34-----------------------

boat. They took care of me and asked me if I am in need. They told   
me they wired my government and my family. They brought me to a   
boarding house, nice room, nice food — and gave me money to spend.   
The capitalist world is more friendly than I thought it would be.   
  
In his struggle to achieve some sense of reality, his perceptions   
of his new environment were faulty. He wavered between beliefs,   
always influenced by his fears:   
  
34 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
I had dinner last night at the home of Mr. Su [a wealthy, retired Hong   
Kong Chinese merchant]. I had the feeling that Mr. Su was a pro-   
Communist. I had this manifestation. Everytime he spoke, I wanted to   
say, "Yes." I thought he was a judge — I was sympathizing with Mr. Su   
because he had a court. He asked me my crimes. I told him all of them   
in order. He said, "Do you feel guilty about this?" I said, "Yes. I feel   
guilty about this." I had the impression he was a judge in contact with   
the Communists and can report everything. . . .   
  
But this morning I wrote a letter to my wife, and I went into detail   
about my crimes. In this letter I denied completely my crimes. I know   
my wife — I know her well — she can't do anything to me, so I wrote,   
"How cruel they were to make a criminal out of someone like me" —   
and yet last night I admitted guilt. Why? Because there was a judge   
there. . . .   
  
Today at lunch with the Jesuit Fathers, I know them well — I denied   
everything because they are my friends. When I feel safe I am on one   
side. When I have the feeling I am not safe, right away I jump on the   
other side.   
  
In his constant testing of his new environment, he began to call   
into question many of the teachings of his thought reform:   
  
When I arrived in Hong Kong, another foreigner coming out of China   
put me in this difficult position. He told me about the situation   
in North China — that it was impossible to get meat there, and that   
there is rationing because everything is going to the Soviet Union. I   
said — "Impossible! A foreigner likes to exaggerate" — because we never   
heard about this rationing in jail. I said, "How can it be possible that   
the Soviet Union needs food from China when they are making such   
progress?" .... In prison we saw their food lists — butter, meat, what-   
ever they like — but now I hear that food is not enough in the Soviet   
Union. I ask myself, "Where is the truth?"   
  
He found that what he was experiencing more and more came   
into conflict with his reform, and he felt that this reality-testing was   
beneficial to him:   
  
They say there is no progress in my country. But I was surprised to see   
a new steamer from there here in the harbor. I hear that it is an air-   

----------------------- Page 35-----------------------

conditioned steamer, built since the war. I thought then that my coun-   
try is not a colony of America — they can have a steamer line come to   
Hong Kong. I started little by little to come to reality — bit by bit to   
make comparison of what they told me. The reality is quite good for   
me. I am thinking that if a school partner [cellmate] could have the   
possibility of seeing what I have seen in eight days — what could he be-   
lieve of his re-education? ....   
  
RE-EDUCATION: DR. VINCENT 35   
  
And similarly when he read in an American magazine about im-   
mense new railroad machinery developed in the United States, he   
questioned the precepts that "the imperialists are interested in only   
light industry — to exploit the people" and that "Soviet heavy in-   
dustry is leading everybody." He commented:   
  
When I saw these, 1 thought that the Communists were cheating me—   
cheating everybody.   
  
Midway through the series of interviews, he began to feel rest-   
less, neglected, and increasingly hostile to his new surroundings. He   
reversed the previous trend, and again became suspicious of ul-   
terior motives in his new environment:   
  
Everyday I read the Hong Kong paper I see children are receiving milk   
and eggs through the help of America. . . . But in prison they are all   
the time saying that the American imperialists are giving things to peo-   
ple in order to cover up — to show that they take an interest I see this   
as a political point — a feeling I have which is strictly connected with   
re-education.   
  
He became markedly critical of what he saw around him, and   
more favorable in his references to his prison experience — looking   
back upon it almost longingly.   
  
Since coming out, arguments and conversation are terribly uninterest-   
ing. There are no concrete things. Time is very superficial — people   
don't solve any problems. They are just going on — spending four hours   
for nothing — between one drink and another smoke and wait for to-   
morrow. In re-education we solved every problem .... we were given   
texts to use and had to read them — then new discussions until the mo-   
ment when there were no more problems. ... I went to a film last   
night. I was disturbed by it. Disturbed because it wasn't an educational   
film — it was just a lot of shooting and violence. I was thinking how   
much more comforting to have an education film as in the prison —   
never a film like this there. So brutal — so much fighting and killing. . . .   
  
When we came out of the movie, a Chinese child touched the hand-   
book of a Western lady who was with us. She was very disturbed and   
kicked the child. I thought, "Why violence, why not just explain to the   
child that he shouldn't do it?" This has a connection with re-education   
— because all of the time they told us that relations in society should   

----------------------- Page 36-----------------------

be on a logical basis, not on a forced basis.   
  
He expressed the loneliness of his new freedom:   
  
36 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
There is this kind of freedom here — if you want to do something, you   
can do it. But there is not the collective way of progress — just an in -   
dividual way of going on. Nobody pays any attention to you and your   
surroundings.   
  
Referring back to his prison experience, he said:   
  
It is not that I miss it, but I find that it was more easy.   
  
At this time he also began to feel that I was "exploiting" him for   
my own professional gain; he "confessed" these feelings to me:   
  
I had a very bad thought about you. I thought that Americans are all   
the same — when they have need of you they use you, and after that   
you are a forgotten man.   
  
But during the last two interviews, he became more cheerful and   
optimistic, more concerned about arrangements for his future. He   
was now more definite in his conviction that the Communists had   
wronged him cruelly throughout his imprisonment.   
  
His views on Communist methods became more sharply critical,   
and more interpretive.   
  
My impression is that they are cruel and that there is no freedom.   
There is compulsion in everything, using Marxism and Leninism in   
order to promise to the ignorant a bright future. ... I was really ac-   
cepting things in order to make myself more comfortable — because I   
was in great fear. ... In this situation your willpower completely dis-   
appears. . . . You accept because there is a compulsion all the time —   
that if you don't go on their road, there is no escape. ... To avoid   
argument you become passive. ...   
  
He described his post-imprisonment change of heart toward his   
former captors — from toleration to condemnation:   
  
My first few days out I recognized that they were cruel with us — but   
not in a strong way. There was a religious belief playing on me: if some-   
one does bad to you, don't keep your hate; and another feeling — what   
I pass through there would be useful for me in the next life. I looked   
upon it as bad versus good, and I felt I suffered for something. . . .   
Now my resentment is stronger than it was the first few days. I have   
the feeling that if I meet a Communist in my country, my first reaction   
toward him will be violent.

----------------------- Page 37-----------------------

  
Before leaving for Europe, he began to seek contacts and letters   
of introduction which he felt could help him in the future. He   
again wished to do medical work in an underdeveloped Asian setting,   
but he noted a significant change in the type of position which he   
sought:   
  
Before I would never accept a nine-to-five job, because it means that   
you are busy all the time with no time to do what you want. Now — it is   
very strange — I would like to have such an engagement. I have the feel-   
ing that with this kind of job, everything is easy. I don't have to think   
of what happens at the end of the month. It would give me security, a   
definite feeling for the future because I have nothing definite in the   
future.   
  
But Dr. Vincent knew himself well enough to recognize that this   
quest for regularity and security would not last.   
  
This is not one hundred per cent of my feeling. . . . You see the con-   
tradiction — I am just out from the door of the cell— only one step out.   
But if I take some more steps — and consider what is best for my char-   
acter — perhaps I will again decide to be by myself. ... In a Com-   
munist country everybody does the same thing — and you accept. Here   
it is different: you are still the master of yourself.   
  
He felt that the most significant change which he had undergone   
as a result of his reform was his increased willingness to "open my-   
self to others." And in regard to our talks together, he said:   
  
This is the first time a foreigner knows my character. I believe this   
comes through re-education — because we were instructed to know our   
internal selves. ... I have never talked so frankly. I have a feeling I   
left part of myself in Hong Kong.   
  
More will be said about Dr. Vincent later on, including his back-   
ground and character; but first I will return to the prison thought   
reform process, and to the different inner experience of a man of   
another calling.   
  
CHAPTER   
  
FATHER LUCA:   
  
THE FALSE CONFESSION   
  
I met Father Francis Luca in a Catholic hospital in   
Hong Kong, where he was convalescing from the   
physical and emotional blows of three-and-one-half years of im-   
prisonment. He had spent ten years in China, and had just arrived   
in the colony a few days before; my visit had been arranged by an-   
other priest whom we both knew. Father Luca's appearance was   
rather striking. An Italian in his late thirties, his eyes looked alert   

----------------------- Page 38-----------------------

and searching, with little of the fear and distance I had seen in Dr.   
Vincent's eyes. But he had a restless, almost driven, quality which   
made it difficult for him, despite a partial physical incapacity caused   
by his imprisonment, to remain seated in his chair. He was inter-   
ested in and curious about everything — about me, about the hos-   
pital, and especially about the significance of his prison experience.   
One of the first things he told me was that immediately upon board-   
ing the British ship which took him from China to Hong Kong, he   
had begun writing down all he could remember of his ordeal so   
that he could record it "before seeing others."   
  
But he too had questions to ask of me: Was I Catholic? And,   
was I an American? My "no" to the first and "yes" to the second   
did not seem to trouble him, or to interfere with the ready flow   
of his words.   
  
Still a little confused during our first talk, he jumped quickly from   
  
5»   
  
FATHER LUCA: THE FALSE CONFESSION 39   
  
subject to subject; yet one theme kept recurring. It was not that of   
the pain or humiliation of his prison experience, but rather his   
sadness at leaving China. He told me that he had cried bitterly   
upon boarding the ship, deeply disturbed at the thought that he   
would never have the chance to return. As he spoke, I noticed   
that the black robe he was wearing was not clerical garb, but the   
robe of a Chinese scholar. There were chopsticks on his eating tabic,   
and the only complaint among his otherwise grateful remarks about   
the hospital was the difficulty he had in obtaining good Chinese   
food, which was the only food he cared to eat. And when another   
European priest paid a brief visit to the room, Father Luca chatted   
happily with him — in Chinese. Whatever the success or failure of   
Father Luca's political reform, he had clearly become a convert to   
Chinese life.   
  
During the month which he spent in the hospital, I paid him   
fourteen visits, spending a total of about twenty-five hours with   
him. Throughout, we were engaged in a common quest for under-   
standing, and he spoke openly and at great length about the details   
of his imprisonment and of his life before that.   
  
Father Luca's arrest had not come as a complete surprise, as   
he had heard that accusations of "subversion" and "anti-Communist   
activities" had been made against him at public meetings. He had   
promised himself that, if imprisoned, he would defend the Church   
and say nothing false. His initial response to interrogation was,   
therefore, one of forthright defiance. When the judge asked him   
whether he knew why he had been arrested, he replied, "It must be   
either due to a misunderstanding or else it is a matter of religion."   
This angered the judge, who insisted, "There is no matter of re-   

----------------------- Page 39-----------------------

ligion. We have freedom of religion in China. It is because you op-   
posed the interests of the people." During subsequent questions   
about his activities and associations in China, Father Luca noticed   
that his interrogator began to dwell particularly upon his relation-   
ship with another priest, Father C, a friend of his whose political   
and military activities against the Communists Father Luca had   
himself criticized.   
  
This first interrogation lasted for just one hour, but it served to   
orient Father Luca for his later confession:   
  
In my mind I had the question, "What will they accuse me of?   
How will they do it?" Now I began to understand — they would put   
  
40 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
the question of my relationship with Father C as the important thing.   
It was good to understand this, but I was not sure how they would go   
about it. I had heard that the Communists made people confess to all   
kinds of fantastic charges. But I was then determined not to admit to   
anything that wasn't true.   
  
He was equally defiant in the cell, penetrating and critical in   
his observations of his captors. When the cell chief advised him that   
he would be quickly released if he would "say all you have done,"   
he skeptically replied: "But I have heard that you have been here   
for six months. Since you must have confessed all of your deeds,   
how is it that you are still here?" And when he witnessed his first   
struggle (against another prisoner) — during which the cell chief   
urged everyone to "help" the man under fire — he thought to him-   
self: "So this is the way of the Communists — using good words to   
do bad things: to help means to maltreat people."   
  
He was awakened from his sleep on the second night and inter-   
rogated about Father C's assistants. He was able to tell the Chris-   
tian name of one, but stated that he did not know the other. The   
judge heatedly insisted: "It is impossible th at you do not know him.   
You are not being honest or sincere." Father Luca bridled at this   
impugning of his integrity, angrily insisting that he was being sin-   
cere, and was telling the entire truth. The judge's immediate re-   
sponse was to order chains with twenty-pound weights placed around   
Father Luca's ankles. He then asked the prisoner the same ques-   
tion, and again received a similar reply. Luca was dismissed and   
sent back to his cell; there the cell chief, upon seeing the chains,   
severely castigated him. When called back less than an hour later,   
his answers still failed to satisfy, and handcuffs were placed about   
his wrists.   
  
During the third night's interrogation, the judge emphasized the   
closeness of Father Luca's relationship with Father C, strongly im-   
plying that he must have known him before coming to China.   
When Luca insisted that they had first met in Peking, the judge   

----------------------- Page 40-----------------------

left the room and Luca was required to sit on the ground with his   
legs, in chains, stretched out. Unable to maintain this position, he   
would lean backward; his weight would then fall on his wrists, which   
were shackled behind his back. Finding the pain of the handcuffs   
digging into his skin and the general discomfort of his position to   
  
FATHER LUCA: THE FALSE CONFESSION 41   
  
be unbearable, thoughts of surrender and compromise came to him   
for the first time:   
  
It is as I have been told. They will have their false confession. But I   
don't want to make a false confession. Maybe there is a way to say   
something that is not totally untrue to satisfy them — but what? ....   
I've said the truth. They don't want the truth. I've only one way to   
escape: to guess what they really want. With all the circumstances of   
my life, the most believable thing was that in going back to Europe   
it was possible to meet him . . . not true, but believable.   
  
He replied that they had met in Europe after the war. The judge   
was still displeased. And at that point, an assistant passed some-   
thing to the judge which to Father Luca looked like a photograph.   
  
I thought, "Certainly this can't be a photograph of Father C and my-   
self taken outside of China. It must be the photograph I made with   
Chinese priests in Rome in 1939 [he had really posed for such a pic-   
ture]. They must be using this photograph as proof that I had seen   
Father C there." I don't know how I came to think this. I gave my mind   
such an explanation because I could not endure the pain. I was coming   
to the conclusion that they wanted me to say I had seen him in Rome.   
I thought it might be according to a story which they wanted to put   
out that Father C was doing espionage work under directions from the   
Vatican. I knew that this was their line from their propaganda.   
  
So, in answer to the judge's original question about their meet-   
ing, Father Luca said: "It was in Rome, in 1939." He was im-   
mediately permitted to stand up, experiencing direct relief of the   
pain, and a few minutes later was taken back to his cell.   
  
The Labyrinth   
  
But the cell chief, acting upon instructions from above, still   
denounced Luca as not "sincere," and ordered that he remain con-   
tinuously standing, in order for him to "meditate" on his "crimes."   
And for the next month — a harrowing maze of nightly interrogations   
and daily struggles — he was kept constantly awake, his cellmates   
alternating in their "night duty," pinching, slapping, and poking   
him to make sure that he did not sleep. Because he was forced to   
maintain a standing position, his legs became swollen and distended   
  
42 THOUGHT REFORM   
  

----------------------- Page 41-----------------------

with fluid. He remembers being permitted to sleep on only three   
occasions: once when he fainted, another time when he became so   
confused that he could not follow the interrogation, and a third   
time when interrogations were postponed because of a heavy storm.   
He estimates that he slept for a total of only sixteen hours during   
this entire four-week period. He became increasingly confused, and   
could no longer tell night from day; he found himself constantly   
straining his faculties in his attempts to understand just what it   
was he was expected to say:   
  
At the beginning it was only a question of curiosity, but afterwards,   
when I couldn't endure it and my mind was confused, I thought, "Why   
don't they say exactly what they want me to say? It is so difficult to   
get at what they want." After two weeks I would say almost anything   
they wanted me to say . . . but of course not easily.   
  
In this state, he "confessed" to three major "crimes": use of a   
concealed radio set to send and receive "espionage" information;   
organization of a ring of young boys for the purpose of conducting   
sabotage and writing anti-Conxmunist publications (the public ac-   
cusation made prior to his imprisonment); and the active participa-   
tion — as "secretary" — in an "espionage organization" allegedly   
headed by Father C. All three of these "admissions" were false,   
built up through half-truths and fabrications.   
  
Father Luca's description of the step-by-step development of these   
"espionage" themes so graphically reveals the unfolding of his   
false confession — and his developing belief in some of his own false-   
hoods^ — that I have allowed him to speak here at some length. As   
he told me about the first of these, the concealed radio theme, I   
was impressed by the complexities of the tortuous process involved:   
  
The first thing about the radio came when the interrogator said: "You   
have other things which you don't speak about, but you can be sure   
that the people know them. Don't think that we're not informed." I   
said that I knew there were some people who said I had a special radio   
— a short wave set. 1 had heard this accusation before I had been   
arrested. I told him there was nothing true about it. He said, "You say   
so, but what is the reality? What have you put in your storeroom   
immediately after the liberation?"   
  
I said that I had put nothing there. Then I thought, "Maybe there   
is something — not a radio — but there was a friend of mine who visited   
me before the Communists came — and entrusted me with some of his   
things." I tried to think whether I had put some of his things in the   
  
FATHER LUCA: THE FALSE CONFESSION 43   
  
storeroom. My mind was not so strong. I said, "Yes — there may be   
some things that I didn't remember." I also knew that there was a boy   
who had worked for us who had turned against us and could have   
reported anything we stored. So, although I did not think there was a   

----------------------- Page 42-----------------------

radio there, I dared not oppose what the judge said. He said, "Was it   
a receiver or a sender?" He said it first because I hadn't known the   
Chinese word for receiver and sender. At first I said that it wasn't   
either. Then I said, "Maybe a receiver — yes — perhaps a sender." There   
was a moment when I had the visualization of an actual sender — but   
I knew best, it was not true. Like sometimes when you are half dream-   
ing and you see something. . . .   
  
Afterwards, when they asked me how it had come into my hands, I   
also had to tell a story about this. I said that my friend went away and   
left it for me, and that a servant had helped me to dismantle it. Then   
the judge said, "You must have been helped by people who understood   
electricity." . . . Then I brought in two more men, an electrician who   
worked in the cathedral, and a young boy who liked to tinker with   
electrical gadgets. . . . The next part also came out logically from   
what I had said before. I thought if somebody would have a radio the   
worst place to keep it would be in the cathedral, because it was known   
that the Communists especially watched churches and frequently made   
accusations that there were radio senders there. So I said I had put it   
some other place. At first I said I couldn't remember the street name.   
When they insisted, I gave them the name: "Ironwall Street." I made   
it up. When the judge told me the following day that he couldn't find   
the street on the map, I told him that perhaps I couldn't remember it   
correctly. . . .   
  
Then I imagined rather clearly a street with a house, a front room,   
and behind the front room a radio sender. I had a clear imagination of   
all this without knowing whether it was true. ... It was like what I   
have heard about writing a novel — imagining people who act in a   
certain way — landscapes and circumstances. For writers, it is very vivid   
— like the real thing — but of course they know that it is not the real   
thing. With me it was really vivid — yet not having totally lost the idea   
that it was untrue. ... I rather tried to have something logical. . . .   
In the cell, the other prisoners made suggestions and it developed that   
I didn't only send messages but also received information. ... So,   
little by little, it became not only once but many times, with many   
other people — and also connected with other priests. ... It became a   
whole organization. ... To some extent I visualized the spy organiza-   
tion. I also invented names and many other details.   
  
The second theme, about the subversive ring of small boys, in-   
cluded a personal confrontation:   
  
After one week the judge interrogated me about a certain Chinese boy.   
I told him the truth, that the name was not familiar to me. Then he   
  
44 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
confronted me with the boy in person, and I told him again that I did   
not know him. But the boy said he knew me, and also that I had told   
him to write anti-Communist pamphlets. I showed some hesitation, as   
I had contact with a thousand boys as a parish priest.   

----------------------- Page 43-----------------------

  
The judge said I was not sincere — put the handcuffs on me again —   
and again made me sit in that extremely painful position until I con-   
fessed that I knew the boy. From this kind of interrogation, and from   
the suggestions which were made in the cell, gradually the confession   
built up. ... I knew that I had been accused of instigating a boy   
to write anti-Communist slogans and to throw stones at street lights.   
. . . Many of the more concrete suggestions came from the cell. The   
chief would say, "You have already said you have done this, you must   
have done more. There must have been more boys." Finally a con-   
fession somehow developed in which I said there had been twenty-five   
boys in this organization whose purpose was conducting sabotage and   
writing anti-Communist publications.   
  
The third, Father C's organization, involved pressures from cell-   
mates, developing the points which Father Luca had already   
"admitted" during the interrogations.   
  
They said, "Well, you certainly did something for Father C." I said,   
"No, that would have been impossible. I had just come to China. I   
didn't know the situation. I didn't know Chinese." They said, "You   
didn't know Chinese, but you do know foreign languages." I admitted   
that I did. And so somehow the suggestion came out that, since I had   
to be doing something for him, maybe it was writing, some kind of   
clerical work. This seemed to be the only thing I could do for him. So   
it came to be like a conviction that not only I could do this, but that   
I had done this. ... I remembered that Father C had once men-   
tioned an uncle of his and an old lady he knew, both in Switzerland.   
So I mixed this thing I heard from him with the suggestion I had   
written letters for him. And so I said I had written letters to that uncle   
and old lady in Switzerland.   
  
They said, "You say you have not participated in his organization.   
Now you say you have written letters for him. That is a connection   
in his organization. Now what was your title? A man who writes letters   
like this for an organization — what is he called? What is his title?".   
. . . They didn't say exactly, but the meaning was very clear. I made   
the reply, "Secretary." After that I knew I must accept the title of   
Secretary. ... I did not really believe I had been a secretary but my   
mind was confused, and I felt it was impossible to refute their [cell-   
mates] arguments. I did develop the conviction that I had written two   
or three letters. It came little by little. ... It is impossible to say   
exactly how these ideas first developed.   
  
FATHER LUCA: THE FALSE CONFESSION 45   
  
Father Luca's false visualizations (or illusions) varied in dura-   
tion from a fleeting moment to a period of a few weeks or months,   
merging into a dream-like state in which   
  
I was mixed up between real and imaginary things and persons. I was   
no longer able to distinguish what was real and what was imaginary.   

----------------------- Page 44-----------------------

... I had the notion that many things were imaginary, but I was not   
sure. I could not say, "This is real," or "This is not real."   
  
This inability to distinguish the real from the unreal extended   
beyond his immediate confession material. Once, just after he had   
fainted,   
  
I had the idea that I was no longer in prison. I had been put in a small   
house outside the cathedral. People were going about outside — chiefly   
Christians. I heard voices and recognized some of them.   
  
But this delusion was by no means completely removed from the   
confession, because in it he "came out into the garden" and saw two   
men, remembering the name of one of them but not of the other.   
And this he related to his interrogators' demands that he name   
"secret agents" (Chinese assistants to foreign priests), and his in-   
ability to remember the name of one of them in particular. The   
next day he questioned whether all of this had really happened, as   
it had become to him "half -dream, half-real." He had two additional   
delusions which also contained fantasies of rescue, but were more   
elaborate — and more lasting:   
  
I had the idea that in the cell next to mine was a priest whom I knew   
very well before. He had also been badly mistreated. One day in bright   
daylight somebody came into his cell and said to him, "You have talked   
very well. Your affair is very simple and it is now finished. We see that   
you are not so bad. We'll take you out this afternoon for a trip to the   
summer palace [in Peking] . After that we will release you."   
  
Then I heard this priest go out with a sigh, and while he was walking   
past my cell, he spoke in Latin — saying the beginning words of the   
Mass — "I shall come unto the altar of God." ... I thought, "Maybe   
he is saying that because in coming out of jail he is glad that tomorrow   
he can say Mass. Or maybe he is offering the pain and the suffering   
experienced to God." ... I remember that at that moment I coughed   
to let him know I was there.   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
So convinced was he that this episode really occurred that one   
year later, during a special movement for the exposure of all "bad   
behavior," he "confessed" to having coughed on this occasion to   
attract the attention of his fellow priest. It was only when he ar-   
rived in Hong Kong after his release, and was told that this other   
priest had never been arrested, that he gave up his belief in this   
incident. And the same was true of another rather similar episode:   
  
Another time, in bright daylight, I had the impression I heard a   
European consul speaking — visiting the prison with a group of people.   
They went to visit another cell — someone else. On their way out, he   
said, "I have heard that Father Luca was also here." There was no   
answer from the prison official. He was just before my cell at that mo-   

----------------------- Page 45-----------------------

ment — so again I coughed — but the officer led him away. I heard him   
talking in the courtyard and I coughed again to let him know I was   
there. But nothing happened. . . . Here in Hong Kong I asked the   
officials of my government whether a consul ever visited the prison.   
They said no, and that it certainly couldn't be true.   
  
These delusions were also related to his confession material and   
to a sense of guilt which was building up within him. For all of   
the characters in them — the other priest, the consul, and himself   
— had been involved in an incident which he had already confessed   
in some detail. Father Luca, in attempting to arrange for a young   
Chinese girl to leave her country and continue her religious studies   
in Europe, had approached the other priest for assistance, and the   
consul for the necessary documents. He had been disturbed by this   
part of his confession because he feared that it might result in the   
imprisonment of the other priest, and also troubled by the realiza-   
tion that he had chosen to help this girl from among many others   
because of affection which he felt for her beyond that of religious   
sympathy. Further, he had come to realize these actions violated   
Chinese Communist law; and although his captors did not make   
much of this, he was troubled by having — in approaching the con-   
sul — used "political means for religious aims."   
  
This was an especially important issue in Father Luca's case   
because, despite his confused state, he continued to struggle against   
any possible betrayal of his loyalty to the Catholic Church. The   
judge had been exerting great pressure upon him to make some ad -   
mission of the Church's relationship to imperialistic activities of   
Western governments. When he refused to do this, he had been   
  
FATHER LUCA: THE FALSE CONFESSION 47   
  
required to resume the painful sitting position in which his hand-   
cuffs dug into his wrists; and the judge further explained, "I don't   
say that the Catholic Church is imperialistic. ... I don't ask you   
to condemn religion . . . but just expect you to recognize that the   
imperialists used it as a 'cloak' for their invasion." And thus un-   
der the pressure of "pain and explanation" Luca made the state-   
ment that "the imperialists used the Catholic Church as a cloak   
to make the invasion of China." For this statement, and for in-   
cluding other missionaries (whom he feared might be consequently   
harmed ) in his confession, he castigated himself severely, and looked   
upon himself as having been "weak."   
  
Yet through his mental haze, he attempted to understand his   
ordeal in terms of his religion:   
  
In the first month I decided "Now I am suffering. It is for me a way   
of having penance for my sins. Now I think also that I have only one   
outlook and one hope — hope in God."   
  
The "Way"   

----------------------- Page 46-----------------------

  
But toward the end of this first month, Luca's physical and men-   
tal condition began to deteriorate. Infections had developed in the   
areas of his legs swollen by the chains. His increasing confusion   
made it difficult for him to keep the details of his confession straight.   
One fabrication required many more to support it, and this "novel,"   
as he called it, became increasingly confused and contradictory.   
Then, during an interrogation session, he noticed the judge was   
moving his papers rapidly from one pile to another, until there   
were almost none left in the first pile. He became convinced that   
his case was close to being "solved," and this hope was further   
fed by the judge's sudden order that the heavy chains be removed   
from his ankles (the handcuffs had been taken off and put back on   
again several times, and at this point were also off). The judge   
then told him to sleep for the next two days, but continued to   
express disapproval concerning the confession, urging that after   
this long rest he come up with the proper material. Despite his   
great fatigue, Luca's fears prevented him from sleeping.   
  
This show of leniency did not help him to add anything to his   
confession. A few nights later, when he had been called for an in-   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
terrogation, the judge asked, "Now, have you any intention of be-   
ing sincere?" Father Luca replied, "I want to be sincere and obe-   
dient, but I am not certain how to do it. I hope you will show me   
a way." To which the judge answered, "I will show you a way,"   
and then called in several prison guards and left the room. These   
newcomers proceeded to gag Father Luca, hold him in a painful   
position, and then over the course of the night, to inflict upon him   
a series of painful injuries, mainly to his back. When they had left   
him about dawn, he lay helpless for about one hour with multiple   
fractures of his vertebral column. Then a young Chinese whom he   
had not met before entered the room and began to speak with him   
softly, in a kind voice, and in Italian — the first time he had heard   
his own language since his arrest. He was solicitous and did every-   
thing possible to make Luca comfortable; then he proceeded to   
question him in detail about his confession, and mostly about his   
relations with Father C.   
  
Luca was affected by this human approach ("His way of ques-   
tioning was objective and impartial. . . . He spoke my own lan-   
guage. ... It was easier for me to confess"). And he now gave a   
relatively accurate version of all of these events, quite different from   
his previous confession. He still felt compelled to exaggerate many   
aspects of it because "I knew if I told only the truth it wouldn't   
be sufficient"; but he included nothing that was grossly false. After   
about two hours, he complained of pain and weakness — both be-   
cause of his physical condition and his realization that "what re-   
mained was difficult." His visitor agreed to end the interview, and   
shortly afterward, when it was discovered that Father Luca could   

----------------------- Page 47-----------------------

not walk, he was carried back to his cell on a stretcher. He later   
learned that he had been interrogated by a "prisoner-official," a   
prisoner so "advanced" in his reform that he functions essentially   
as a staff member. So impressed was Luca with the special quality   
of this session that, when he was in difficulty on several other oc-   
casions later on, he asked to see this Italian-speaking prisoner-of-   
ficial again.   
  
He was also at this time examined by a physician who confirmed   
his fear that his spine had been broken, but spoke to him reassur-   
ingly and told him that after some time it would heal.   
  
The months which followed were especially trying. His case was   
less resolved than ever, and he was now physically completely help-   
  
FATHER LUCA: THE FALSE CONFESSION 49   
  
less, dependent upon his cellmates for his every need. After several   
days of lying on the stone floor, he was given a hard wooden bed   
with a rough blanket. He was visited on just one more occasion by   
the doctor, who arranged for his cellmates to request additional   
clothes and blankets from Father Luca's mission organization, which   
still existed on the outside. Luca derived some comfort from this   
because "I felt better about their beginning to take care of me."   
But the only medical treatment he received at this time was the   
prescription of some leg exercises. His requests for assistance with   
urination or defecation were frequently refused; this, combined   
with his partial loss of control over both his urinary and anal sphinc-   
ters (on a neurological basis due to his injury) resulted in frequent   
soiling of his bedclothes and the cell. The odors caused further re-   
sentment and severe criticism from his cellmates, living as they   
were in an intimacy which made every occurrence the experience   
of all.   
  
In addition, Luca's immobility led to the development of severely   
infected bedsores on his back, thighs, and toes. At first these were   
treated very inadequately with iodine and other topical applications;   
but after objections had been raised by his cellmates to the odor   
that emanated from them, he received more effective treatment   
in the form of careful bandaging and penicillin injections.   
  
Luca constantly maintained attempts to recover his physical   
capacities. After a short period of time he began to exercise his   
toes; after three months he could begin to sit up; after one year, he   
could stand, leaning against the wall. Not until fifteen months after   
his injury was he able to walk to the toilet. His cellmates at first   
assisted him in his exercises, but their "help" was frequently so   
rough that it caused him great pain — and on one such occasion he   
cried out so loudly that a prison official heard him, and came run-   
ning into the cell to find out what the trouble was. After this, his   
cellmates offered little assistance.   
  

----------------------- Page 48-----------------------

Despite his physical incapacity, Luca was required to take part   
in cell activities — confession and reform. Immediately after his   
injury, this consisted of answering "little papers" sent down from   
the officials, asking specific questions about such matters as his   
relationship with Father C, and his activities on behalf of Catholic   
organizations in China. Not long afterward more exhausting ac-   
tivity was required of him: he had to participate in the intermi-   
  
50 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
nable cell "study" activities. When he would doze off — as he did   
frequently — the cell chief would strike him smartly on top of his   
head with a straw brush.   
  
Luca's inner experiences during this period were those of ex-   
treme humiliation, helplessness, and depression:   
  
I could do nothing for myself. . . . During the night if I had to   
urinate, I had to wake the man near me. ... I was sorrowful. ... I   
thought, "I can never be well again. My legs will never be cured. I will   
be helpless in everything. ..." I thought much about my parents,   
how they must be suffering about me. ... I wept several times, chiefly   
during the night.   
  
He found comfort, reassurance, and an outlet for his feelings only   
through his fantasies, which usually concerned rich emotional ex-   
periences he had known in the past: places and people he had   
loved, songs with special meaning, his home, and his mother.   
  
I was thinking mostly at night of places I had been — walking with my   
parents, my brother and sister . . . chiefly of home . . . and of holi-   
day journeys. . . . Once I had the strange feeling I had come back to   
Europe to my parents. ... I had another thing — not exactly a dream   
— but like an obsession, maybe a pastime. I would try to remember   
geographical names — names of towns I knew all over the world —   
sometimes of rivers and seas also — a kind of geographical hobby. . . .   
I have always been rather interested in geography. . . . When I was   
in very bad condition, I would sing, externally or internally — chiefly   
rather sorrowful songs: Negro spirituals — Swannee River, Josiah, Old   
Kentucky Home, Home on the Range — these songs in English . . .   
also, European songs and songs I sang with the Legion of Mary and   
other religious groups . . . religious songs from Holy Week, also rather   
sad. They gave me a remembrance of my life in the Church with the   
youth in China. . . . When I was particularly in bad shape, I sang   
Negro spirituals . . . and also one song my mother sang to me when   
I was a little boy — a Negro baby song. ... It was sorrowful, but an   
opportunity to express oneself, a kind of relief.   
  
Later in his imprisonment, he was able to share some of these   
emotions:   
  
There was in my cell for a while a young fellow, a Chinese Catholic.   

----------------------- Page 49-----------------------

I knew he was a Catholic, but it wasn't possible for us to say anything   
or to speak about religion. But at recreation time, we sometimes sang   
songs. He was fond of music and knew many songs — Schubert, Bee-   
  
FATHER LUCA: THE FALSE CONFESSION 51   
  
thoven, Christmas carols. He would sing the tune, then I would sing —   
sometimes together. It was a way to express a community of feelings —   
the others didn't understand. ... He was on the outside a good   
prisoner — he said nothing against the Communist doctrine — and if   
not for the singing I might have doubted that he still had the Catholic   
faith. ... He was also a comfort for me.   
  
Beginning AU Over   
  
Three months after the injury (and four months after his ar-   
rest), Luca had an unexpected visitor in the cell: the judge ap-   
peared to announce a dramatic reversal in the official attitude to-   
ward the confession material. He told Luca that it was confused,   
inaccurate, and incomplete; and he gave an example of what he   
meant ("Why, as for L. [a Chinese allegedly the 'chief of an 'es-   
pionage' organization], you probably don't even know him.") He   
urged the prisoner to "begin all over again" and this time "tell only   
the truth." He informed him that he was to be transferred to a   
new cell "where you will be better able to write things."   
  
Luca was struck by the irony of the judge's statement — not   
too long before his reluctance to confess to an incriminating re-   
lationship with this same L. had resulted in his being placed in   
chains. But he was immensely pleased at what seemed to be an   
opportunity to clarify things and rid himself of the painful burden   
of maintaining his falsehoods. His hopefulness increased when he   
noted an improved atmosphere in the new cell and more consider-   
ate cellmates.   
  
But his sense of relief was transient. When he began to dictate   
a denial of his three major "crimes" and a more accurate statement   
of his activities and associations (his limited knowledge of written   
Chinese, and poor physical condition prevented him from writing   
it out himself) the cell chief refused to accept the retraction; he   
told Luca that he was not yet "psychologically fit" to prepare his   
materials, and that if what he said were true, and he had really done   
nothing wrong, he would certainly not have been arrested.   
  
Luca's dilemma was now greater than ever:   
  
The judge said — "You must not tell untrue things." On the other   
hand, when I told only real things, this was considered insufficient and   
I was not allowed to write them. I was in great psychological pain. I   
felt it was impossible to satisfy these people.   
  
52 THOUGHT REFORM   

----------------------- Page 50-----------------------

  
There followed a return of the vindictive treatment — struggles,   
angry denunciations, and physical abuse: thumbs, pencils, or chop-   
sticks pressed under his chin or between his fingers, and painful   
ear-pulling. Attempts to tell the truth brought no relief.   
  
Finally Luca came upon what seemed to him to be the only   
solution:   
  
I thought, "I must find a way. There must be a way of giving real   
facts — and then presenting them as being bigger [more incriminating]   
than they were." . . . Maybe this would satisfy cnem. . . . From this   
time on I had this idea.   
  
Soon afterward, during a prisonwide confession and self-accusa-   
tion movement, he found himself implementing this new approach.   
As confession pressures mounted and competitive feelings developed   
among the prisoners ("I can tell one guilty fact. ... I can tell   
three guilty facts . . ."), Luca was himself heavily struggled and   
at the same time drawn into the group emotions.   
  
Now — and for the remainder of his imprisonment — he began to   
make "real things bigger." He imbued with an aura of espionage   
and intelligence such events as conversations with young girls in   
his religious groups and routine comments made to colleagues   
about the Chinese political and military situation during the Civil   
War. In this way he built up an impressive series of admissions:   
"Passing military information" to Father C, conveying "political   
and economic intelligence" to "imperialists" in Hong Kong, en-   
gaging in "reactionary activities" in the Legion of Mary (a militant,   
partly clandestine Catholic organization greatly resented by the   
Communists), and many additional "crimes" — all distorted exag-   
gerations of his real activities, rather than the more "creative   
fantasy" of his earlier false confessions.   
  
And in response to continuing pressures, he began to dictate   
to a fellow prisoner (and later write out himself) a lengthy account   
of his entire stay in China, covering "generally speaking all of my   
behavior, although emphasizing what could be considered misbe-   
havior." His efforts were well received ("The cell chief now looked   
upon me as a man with whom it is possible to do something"), and   
he felt the urge to produce more and more material.   
  
This urge was intensified when, after one year, a general prison   
reorganization took place in which a new and more moderate   
  
FATHER LUCA: THE FALSE CONFESSION 53   
  
policy was instituted. 1 Through manipulations from above, the   
cell chief was struggled and severely criticized for his encourage-   
ment of physical abuse, and then he (along with everyone else in   
the cell except Luca) was transferred and replaced.   

----------------------- Page 51-----------------------

  
After this Luca received no more beatings or physical pressures   
of any kind; but the new chief instituted a regime of increased   
psychological demands ("Although caring for my body, he was   
rather unpleasant to my spirit"). These demands took the form   
of twice-daily sessions during which all prisoners were required to   
write down and discuss their "bad thoughts," as well as increas-   
ing demands upon Luca to condemn Church activities and to record   
"bad behavior" of any variety. Now Luca began to pour out in great   
detail information about all of his clerical activities in China as   
well as activities of his associates, especially emphasizing whatever   
could be constructed as "reactionary."   
  
I thought — it is so difficult to find out what they think is bad — so   
the best way I had was to write everything. . . . The idea came to   
me that if I don't confess something that is true, I won't be able to get   
rid of the things that are false.   
  
He even began, like others in his cell, to invent "bad thoughts":   
  
Formerly it was a pressure to invent facts about before I was arrested.   
Now it became a pressure to invent ideas. ... I had to say, for in-   
stance, that I had all kinds of good feelings about President Truman,   
which was a bad thing — although I really had no special feeling either   
for or against him.   
  
For a period of two weeks he did nothing but write out material   
about himself and others. Under this impulse to tell all, he con-   
fessed for the first time that he and some other priests had ar-   
ranged a code together, used mostly in mail to inform friends and   
relatives in Europe of their personal safety and of the state of the   
Church in China. He gave this information now, even though he   
had carefully held it back during his confused state in the first   
month, and also in the more "relaxed" interview which just fol-   
lowed his injury. Much to his surprise, the judge made little of   
it, and it was never included as part of his formal confession; none-   
theless, he regretted it later on when he discovered, after his re-   
lease, that one of the priests involved had been arrested.   
  
54 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
He began to feel his efforts were being encouraged. The judge   
paid another visit to his cell, and this time was even more friendly   
in his assertion that Luca had a perfect right to deny any accusa-   
tion which was not completely justified. Yet despite this, Luca con-   
tinued over the months to experience increasing emotional tension,   
especially when he was criticized in connection with his religion.   
The problem came to a head during a special confession movement,   
when he strongly objected to the cell chief's assertion that he "used   
religion only as a cloak" for his alleged espionage activities:   
  
I replied violently, "This is not a cloak. A cloak is easy to remove. But   

----------------------- Page 52-----------------------

for me if you want to take off my religion, it is necessary to take out my   
heart and to kill me."   
  
The cell chief then told him that although he had improved in   
many ways, his anger was a form of bad behavior which he should   
take up in his self-criticisms, and that there must be still in his   
soul something which prevented him from having full confidence   
in the government.   
  
Luca admitted that there were things still disturbing him, but   
said that he was unable to discuss them in the cell, and requested   
that he be allowed to see the prisoner-official who had spoken to   
him kindly and in his own language just after his injury. This was   
arranged, and Luca took part in two remarkable therapeutic ses-   
sions with this man, which ushered in a period of greater intimacy   
between himself and his captors. During the first, speaking "frankly   
but with caution," he said that he was still "grieving" about his   
deformed bodily state (avoiding any direct accusations, and speak-   
ing of it as "illness"); that he was still concerned about young girls   
in the Legion of Mary who had been beaten in their schools; and   
that he still had great doubts about whether there really was free-   
dom of religion in China. In saying these things Luca felt the mixed   
motivations characteristic for the thought reform experience:   
  
I felt that these would be bad things to say in the cell because there   
they would cause me trouble. But I knew that to say something would   
give me relief. I also knew it would have a favorable result — that the   
officials would consider me frank and would have understanding for   
me.   
  
One month later a second meeting was arranged during which   
the prisoner-official gave a startlingly "reasonable" answer to the   
  
FATHER LUCA: THE FALSE CONFESSION 55   
  
points which Luca had previously raised — including the first semi-   
official recognition of fallibility on the part of the government:   
  
It is true that there have been wrong things in your case, but you must   
remember that your behavior was at first very antagonistic to the govern-   
ment. . . . When you spoke in a such a confused manner, the judge   
lost his temper. This, of course, was not right, but in any case you   
should try to understand the circumstances . . . perhaps some people   
have been mishandled in prisons — but you must remember that in   
seventeenth-century England and during the French Revolution, this   
also happened. And if you will take a look at the greater picture, you   
will see that there is better control of the population in China now to   
prevent these excesses than there was in either England or in France   
during these other periods.   
  
This explanation deeply impressed Luca although it did not com-   
pletely dispel his belief that the Communists should have gone a   

----------------------- Page 53-----------------------

step further and made public admission of and reparations for   
their excesses.   
  
Near the end of his second year of imprisonment, he began to   
work on what eventually became his final confession document.   
Told first to write it out in his own language, he summarized the   
main points of his prison-prepared "autobiography," and then trans-   
lated these himself into Chinese. Next he was brought before a   
new and apparently high-ranking judge for a one-week period of   
severe, "rather correct," but sometimes threatening interrogation:   
"I see you do not yet have a good knowledge of your sins. You   
really ought to be punished very severely, perhaps ten years in   
prison." With the aid of the old judge, the new judge, and the   
prisoner-official, Luca evolved a four-point confession full of "in-   
telligence" implications, but so close to actual events that Luca   
himself felt it to be "almost real."   
  
Church Under Attack   
  
During Luca's remaining eighteen months of imprisonment, the   
cell study program put great emphasis on a critical analysis of the   
Church's activities in China. Luca admitted that certain priests   
were out of line in their political and even military activities in   
China (he had criticized colleagues for such behavior even before   
his arrest); but at the same time he emphasized that the great   
majority were concerned only with their religious activities. This   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
attitude, he was told, was not progressive because it did not take   
into account the principles of "collective responsibility":   
  
If one in a family makes a mistake, it is the fault of the entire family;   
if one priest does something wrong, and is not stopped by the higher   
authorities, the Church authorities are at fault.   
  
When Luca would try to point out the good that the Church   
had done, its service to the sick and to the poor, he met this argu-   
ment:   
  
This is still a form of aid to imperialism, because the sick and the poor   
and other Chinese people are led to believe that good is emanating   
from foreigners, conveying a favorable impression of foreigners in gen-   
eral, and therefore making propaganda for and serving the purposes of   
the imperialists.   
  
Similarly, when Luca responded to arguments against the "old   
China hand" attitude of many priests — their lavish living habits and   
distance from the common people — by pointing out his own in-   
tegration into Chinese life — Chinese friends, services conducted   
in Chinese, living in the Chinese manner — he was told that his   
behavior was even worse, because it "deceived the people."   

----------------------- Page 54-----------------------

  
Luca found this kind of argument extremely disturbing:   
  
It was the most difficult of their reasoning to counteract. . . . What   
you do that is good — is bad — precisely because it is good!   
  
He continued to experience his greatest inner pain whenever   
religion was discussed; and because of his imperfect attitude, he   
was frequently criticized as "stubborn," "subjective," and "having   
backward ideas." But increasingly he stifled whatever inner protest   
he felt, and began to express himself cautiously, in a manner con-   
sistent with the Communist point of view wherever possible; at   
the same time he immersed himself in "facts and logic" — in the   
elaboration of small detail.   
  
He was considered to have made some "progress." Toward the   
middle of his third year of imprisonment, he was sent to a different   
compound with a more liberal routine: exercise periods in the   
courtyard, more leeway in going to the toilet, and less suffocating   
discipline. Here hsiieh hsi was the main task, and Luca was criti-   
  
FATHER LUCA-. THE FALSE CONFESSION 57   
  
cized repeatedly for not telling his real thoughts. This accusation   
was upsetting because it was partially true.   
  
Sometimes I dared not say some things. . . . Sometimes I really was   
telling what I thought. . . . And sometimes when I was, they still said   
I wasn't telling enough.   
  
Even during this "improved" period, Luca was not free of out-   
ward signs of psychological disturbance, and suffered from in-   
somnia and "general nervousness." When in response to cellmates'   
questions he admitted that he was praying at night, he would be   
told that he shouldn't do this, since it must be what was keeping   
him awake.   
  
About nine months before his release, he was confronted with   
what turned out to be the last major demand for "betrayal." The   
judge insis ted that he write a letter to one of the young girls who   
had been most actively associated with him in the Legion of Mary,   
telling her that the Legion was a "reactionary organization led by   
spies" with "nothing religious about it," and that she should   
confess to the government all of her "reactionary activities." Luca   
was warned, "Remember, your future depends upon how you   
write this." After much pressure and conflict ("because of fear, and   
because I could not resist the moral pressure"), Luca finally wrote   
the letter. His first draft — which made some mention of things   
done for religion — was rejected; and in his final draft, he stated   
that he had deceived them in leading them to join the Legion of   
Mary, that he was wrong in telling them to "resist the govern-   
ment," and that he had done so because of his "imperialistic rela-   

----------------------- Page 55-----------------------

tions."   
  
His letter did not go quite as far as the original request: he did   
not, for instance, include the phrase, "nothing religious about it."   
This served to give him some sense of a small victory; but the entire   
incident was a source of such great pain that it was one of the   
matters he found most difficult to discuss with me.   
  
After that — this was my chief grievance — I felt I was a coward. I said   
something that was to be used to trouble people, and while not con-   
trary to the essentials of the Church, could make a lot of trouble for   
religious work. . . . And I felt that these girls and other people had   
probably been more firm than I. ... I should have been their leader   
— but I was not as strong as they.   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
A short time later, he was told by his cellmates, "You are nervous,   
full of fear. ... You must have more things to say." He was then   
called before an official to discuss this matter. Luca approached   
this man openly, and asked him two questions which had long been   
troubling him: Would it be possible for him to remain in China   
after his release from prison? What was the real point of view of   
the government about religion? He was told that the government   
was not opposed to foreigners living and working in China, and   
that he would be able to stay; that the government did not oppose   
religion; and all those who did not oppose the religious reform   
movement could continue their religious activities. The reform   
movement referred to was the Communist-sponsored, nationwide,   
"triple autonomy" campaign for all of Chinese Christianity, ad-   
vocating Chinese rather than foreign direction of worship, funds,   
and organization. To the Communists, this movement was merely   
a way to cast off outside "imperialist" influence and form a "na-   
tional church"; but most of the Catholic missionaries saw it as a   
way to get the Church under direct Communist control. The Legion   
of Mary was strongly opposed to the reform movement, but Luca   
himself had favored a much more moderate position than some   
of his superiors. In this discussion, the official conceded that Luca   
"was not like other foreigners," as he had always been against the   
presence of foreign troops and Western concessions in China; but   
at the same time the official strongly condemned Luca for his re-   
peated defense of the Church in the cell, and insisted that he was   
attempting to influence the cell chief, a Chinese Catholic who was   
bitterly critical of Church activities. In this and other talks with   
officials, there was a sense of better mutual understanding than in   
previous talks, although Luca nonetheless encountered periodic   
outbursts of personal "struggles" and vindictive criticism, largely   
relating to the issue of the Church.   
  
There were also indications that Luca's imprisonment might   
soon come to an end: the appearance of other foreigners, including   
another priest, in his cell; more rewriting, translating, and summariz-   

----------------------- Page 56-----------------------

ing of his confession with the help of his compatible prisoner-   
official; orders for the foreigners to send for their luggage. His con-   
fession, simplified and clearly damning, was finally pruned down   
to just two points: his relationship with Father C, and his Legion   
of Mary activities. In the first, "espionage" was still mentioned;   
  
FATHER LUCA: THE FALSE CONFESSION 59   
  
and in the second, a new emphasis was placed upon details of   
organizational structure and membership. The confession was ac-   
curate to the extent that it included only real events; it was distorted   
only in the interpretation of these events. When the confession   
was in final form, Luca was called into a special room, where he was   
photographed and recorded reading it aloud.   
  
During his last weeks of imprisonment, Luca experienced what   
was perhaps his highest point of co-operation with his captors.   
During a last "confession movement," he brought out yet more   
details about his resistance to the government in his Legion of   
Mary work. After this, he became actively involved in helping two   
newcomers to confess. With one of them, he felt justified:   
  
I believed that his attitude wasn't good — he had done bad things —   
beatings and possibly killing people. There was no use for him not to   
confess.   
  
But the other man was a Chinese Catholic priest, which put   
Luca in a difficult situation:   
  
It was for me a very great strain. I dared not stay out of helping him,   
but I would not enforce upon him things I felt were wrong. I tried to   
make a compromise — to find real facts which were not against religion,   
to let him use words that didn't imply something. But either he did   
not understand my tactics, or else he just would not use them.   
  
These incidents of co-operation — and especially the second — were   
also difficult for Luca to discuss.   
  
His final sessions with judges and officials were held in an atmos-   
phere of friendly exchange between reasonable people. There was,   
however, some talk about a ten-year sentence. Luca admitted some   
of his "errors," and certain specific "bad behavior" concerning his   
relationship with Father C and with the Legion of Mary; but he   
emphasized that at the time, he had been unaware he was com-   
mitting a "crime." The judge said:   
  
We know we made mistakes with you — that is, with your body — but   
when you go away you must also admit that you had some faults, and   
you must not exaggerate what happened here. . . . You must realize   
that at the beginning it was difficult for us to fully master the prison   
situation — we had many bad people among the other prisoners — and   
now all of the beatings have stopped, which shows that our real policy   

----------------------- Page 57-----------------------

  
60 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
is not so bad as might seem if one were to consider only what happened   
to you during the first year.   
  
Luca responded by agreeing that he had observed these improve-   
ments in prison procedure.   
  
During one of these interviews he was told for the first time that   
he was to be expelled from China; official confirmation came a few   
minutes later when he was taken before another judge and another   
official, who read the formal sentence. The "crimes" named had   
been reduced to three: the "military information" to Father C,   
his Legion of Mary activities (both included in his last confession),   
and "information to imperialists" transmitted in letters written   
from China.   
  
Luca had mixed feelings about the resolution of his case:   
  
Of course I felt some relief — the feeling that now it is all finished — no   
more strain. But at the same time I had the feeling that the conclusion   
is not totally satisfying — I didn't want to be out of my missionary   
work — and not see the many friends — the Christians left there — and   
no longer have any connection with them. ... I also had the feeling   
that the things I said in the beginning were retracted — but that all of   
the case was not totally clear.   
  
Release and Search   
  
He still had these mixed feelings when he boarded the ship   
which took him from China to Hong Kong. On the way, he ex-   
perienced transient beliefs that there must be Communists among   
the sailors who would report on his shipboard behavior. He also   
observed and described to me the sequence of his feelings about his   
experience: the first day, sadness at leaving China; second day,   
chagrin at his "needless suffering" in an experience so "stupid and   
meaningless"; third and fourth days, the feeling that the Church   
had made mistakes in China which should be corrected; fifth and   
sixth days, a vague melancholy. When he landed in Hong Kong on   
the seventh day, he was quoted by reporters as saying that his arrest   
had been due to a "misunderstanding" — avoiding then any strong   
statement or condemnation.   
  
When I saw him a few days later, his paranoid thinking had dis-   
appeared, his depression had diminished, and his attitude was no   
  
FATHER LUCA: THE FALSE CONFESSION 6l   
  
longer neutral. He was once more the dedicated Catholic priest,   
preoccupied with the problems of his Church, cared for, attended   
to, and continuously visited by his religious colleagues. His prin-   

----------------------- Page 58-----------------------

cipal regret was his inability to maintain allegiance to both the   
Church and to China:   
  
To leave the prison was to be expelled — if I could have left the prison   
without having been expelled, I would have liked that most.   
  
By the second interview (just two days after the first) little   
confusion remained: he spoke clearly of the "false accusations"   
made against him, of his conviction that he had been "unjustly"   
treated. But he did not stop with these condemnations; rather, he   
embarked upon a determined search for understanding of his   
ordeal. He sought — through meditations, talks with me, and his   
writings — to discover why the Communists had behaved as they   
did, what mistakes the Church had made in China which might   
have contributed to this behavior, and how he, as a priest who had   
undergone an ordeal, could help his Church to improve itself in   
the future. He told me of the detailed reconstruction of his entire   
imprisonment which he had begun while on the ship, essentially   
for his own use; of the special reports he was preparing for Church   
authorities; of the articles he was writing for Catholic periodicals.   
One of these articles dealt with apologetics, and refuted the Com-   
munist point of view on religion. Another article was a detailed re-   
port on the activities of the Legion of Mary in China.   
  
When I was in jail they had me write very much about this. Now I   
would like to write freely about it and have a good look at the thing.   
. . . My aim is to have a document that a few people can study to   
see whether we made mistakes, and how these can be corrected. . . .   
And to show what were the false accusations that the Communists   
made against us.   
  
Others were more simple vignettes of Catholic faith: he told of   
praying to the Virgin Mary during a painful ordeal of struggle   
and beating, which resulted in the immediate arrival of prison of-   
ficials who stopped the abuse; and of the progress of a little Chinese   
girl, at first "naughty" and "fierce," whom Luca had succeeded in   
converting to active Catholicism despite the initial opposition of   
her parents. So preoccupied was he with these activities that it was   
  
62 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
not until the third session with me that he went into any detail   
about his prison experience.   
  
When he did, it was usually in a self-deprecating manner. He   
spoke of his "weakness," his "cowardly behavior," of his failure to   
set a proper example as a leader of Chinese Christian youth. Nor   
could he always find comfort from talking with his fellow priests   
in Hong Kong: some would express amazement at his having made   
such a false confession, and he would interpret this as a feeling on   
their part of his having let the Church down; others received him   
as something of a hero, and this made him feel no better.   

----------------------- Page 59-----------------------

  
People now say, "You are wonderful. You have suffered so much — like   
a martyr." I become uncomfortable and confused when they say this.   
There are so many things I should have done better.   
  
Martyrdom was for him an ideal which he felt he had failed to   
live up to, and he viewed his imprisonment as a missed opportunity.   
  
I felt not too useful because I had an insufficiently good attitude — and   
because I had confessed to false things. I had the idea of a somewhat   
wasted occasion.   
  
He summed up his feelings in the language of the Church:   
  
I am guilty of many sins, but not the ones that the Communists accuse   
me of; and I hope to make amends for my sins.   
  
Yet it did mean a great deal to him to be once more living in a   
world of priests, nuns, and fellow Christians. He was especially   
pleased when he received visits from young colleagues, former   
students, or from Chinese Christian youths who told him of the   
inspiration they had derived from his leadership in the past.   
  
As he continued his explorations, he remained thoughtful and   
moderate in his views about the Communists as well as about his   
own Church, and always qualified his judgments. Concerning his   
own treatment, he said:   
  
I think it is wrong to seek by evil means such guilty interpretation of   
my behavior. ... I feel that they treated me wrongly. ... Of course   
it is better that they admitted their mistakes — and let me retract. But   
even when they admit their mistakes, they don't go to the bottom of   
the question of why they make mistakes.   
  
FATHER LUC A: THE FALSE CONFESSION   
  
The reasons for these Communist "mistakes" were, he felt:   
  
They are prejudiced against the Catholic Church. . . . They are too   
confident about their own judgment. . . . They are not sufficiently   
correct about criticizing or punishing their own misbehavior, or that of   
their semi-official associations.   
  
He had some praise for the Chinese Communist regime as well;   
he recognized its accomplishments in building and industry, he   
was impressed with their planned production, and he felt that   
many of their concepts about economics were "logical." And al-   
though he himself had long been critical of the Nationalist Regime   
which preceded the Communists, its shortcomings, and especially   
its corruption, had become more vivid to him: "I have somewhat   
more understanding of the reason why so many people in China   
were discontented with the old order."   

----------------------- Page 60-----------------------

  
Nonetheless, he believed that the Chinese people were paying   
a heavy price for their accomplishments — especially in the "great   
strain" being imposed upon them, and in the limitations upon their   
thought. He thought the Communists were particularly deficient   
in "the question about how to let people have their own ideas, and   
especially about a way of making justice in the courts." There had   
been some improvement, he felt, but not enough:   
  
At the beginning they were totally wrong; since three years ago, they   
have been in some ways better, but not sufficiently so that one could   
say that their ways were good.   
  
Father Luca also had pointed and specific criticism for his own   
Church. He especially disapproved of those among the Catholic   
priests who became involved in military activities against the   
Chinese Communists, both on ethical and practical grounds: "I   
think it is not according to the Christian way of proceeding — and   
it is of no use." He claimed that he had always disapproved of these   
activities, but he had been made to feel during his imprisonment   
that he had "indulged" those among his friends who pursued such   
policies, and now his opposition was more firm. He was also critical   
of foreign priests who lived too lavishly in China ("They forgot the   
spirit of poverty"), and more basically of the Church's failure to   
build up a highranking Chinese hierarchy, and its tendency to keep   
foreign priests in the senior positions in China. He felt that both   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
the Communists and the Church should mend their ways: that the   
former should admit and correct their mistakes and develop a   
"more fair attitude" towards religion; and that the latter should   
"see more what was wrong in our attitudes" and then seek to   
change them.   
  
In all of this, Father Luca maintained a distinction between the   
fallible actions of individual priests, and his more basic religious   
convictions:   
  
When there was criticism of priests, I knew that much was true, and   
I admitted it. But about the existence of God — I was convinced of the   
emptiness of their arguments when they said there was no God.   
  
His religious feelings aside, Luca felt he had undergone an im-   
portant personal change. He found himself more willing to listen   
to others' opinions, more patient, and less quick to "get in anger."   
He also thought that he had become more articulate, and had   
largely overcome a previous tendency to "feel nervous because I   
couldn't express the things I wanted to say."   
  
During the month in which we were working together, Luca   
showed periodic signs of restlessness, "nervous diarrhea," and   

----------------------- Page 61-----------------------

anxiety concerning his future. But these gradually diminished as   
he became increasingly focused and relaxed within the Hong Kong   
Catholic setting. His physical condition also improved, although   
he was told that he would never be well enough for the active life   
of a parish priest. He showed throughout an obvious reluctance to   
leave Hong Kong; although it was not China proper, it had at least   
a partial Chinese atmosphere, and permitted him to use the   
Chinese language. At first he expressed this directly: "I regret the   
possibility that I may have to go back to Europe." But gradually,   
he began to accept the inevitable, and when he finally left, he was   
looking ahead to future work. Yet he also looked back to his life   
in China — and his mood was one of sadness.   
  
CHAPTER   
  
PSYCHOLOGICAL STEPS   
  
There is a basic similarity in what both Dr. Vincent   
and Father Luca experienced during Communist   
imprisonment. Although they were held in separate prisons far re-   
moved from each other, and although they differed very much in   
their responses to reform, they were both subjected to the same   
general sequence of psychological pressures. This sequence was es-   
sentially the same despite the fact that these men were very dif-   
ferent from each other, with different personal and professional life   
styles. Nor was this thought reform pattern common to just these   
two: it was experienced by all twenty-five of the Westerners whom   
I interviewed.   
  
The common pattern becomes especially important in evaluating   
the stories these Westerners told me. Each was attempting to   
describe, in most instances as accurately as possible, the details of   
an ordeal from which he had just emerged. But what each reported   
was also inevitably influenced by his immediate life situation — his   
psychological transition between the two worlds, his personal   
struggles for both integrity and integration, his feelings about suc-   
coring and threatening colleagues and strangers in Hong Kong, his   
view of me as an American, a physician, a psychiatrist, and a   
person. All of these circumstances could affect his account, and   
especially its emotional tone. Therefore, both during the inter-   
views and in the later study of my notes, I had to sift out what was   
  
65   
  
66 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
most characteristic and most consistent, to evaluate this informa-   
tion in terms of my understanding of the people supplying it, and   
then to piece together a composite analysis of the process itself.   
  
Death and Rebirth   
  

----------------------- Page 62-----------------------

Both Dr. Vincent and Father Luca took part in an agonizing   
drama of death and rebirth. In each case, it was made clear that   
the "reactionary spy" who entered the prison must perish, and that   
in his place must arise a "new man," resurrected in the Communist   
mold. Indeed, Dr. Vincent still used the phrase, "To die and be   
reborn" — words which he had heard more than once during his   
imprisonment.   
  
Neither of these men had himself initiated the drama; indeed,   
at first both had resisted it, and tried to remain quite outside of   
it. But their environment did not permit any sidestepping: they   
were forced to participate, drawn into the forces around them until   
they themselves began to feel the need to confess and to reform.   
This penetration by the psychological forces of the environment   
into the inner emotions of the individual person is perhaps the   
outstanding psychiatric fact of thought reform. The milieu brings   
to bear upon the prisoner a series of overwhelming pressures, at   
the same time allowing only a very limited set of alternatives for   
adapting to them. In the interplay between person and environ-   
ment, a sequence of steps or operations 5 — of combinations of   
manipulation and response — takes place. All of these steps revolve   
about two policies and two demands: the fluctuation between   
assault and leniency, and the requirements of confession and re-   
education. The physical and emotional assaults bring about the   
symbolic death; leniency and the developing confession are the   
bridge between death and rebirth; the re-education process, along   
with the final confession, create the rebirth experience.   
  
Death and rebirth, even when symbolic, affect one's entire being,   
but especially that part related to loyalties and beliefs, to the sense   
of being a specific person and at the same time being related to   
and part of groups of other people — or in other words, to one's   
sense of inner identity. 2 In the broadest terms, everything that hap-   
pened to these prisoners is related to this matter. Since everyone   
differs from everyone else in his identity, each prisoner experienced   
  
PSYCHOLOGICAL STEPS   
  
thought reform differently, nor did anyone respond completely to   
all these steps; at the same time, the experiences had such magnitude   
that they affected every prisoner in some measure, no matter what   
his background and character.   
  
1. THE ASSAULT UPON IDENTITY   
  
From the beginning, Dr. Vincent was told he was not really a   
doctor, that all of what he considered himself to be was merely a   
cloak under which he hid what he really was. And Father Luca   
was told the same thing, especially about the area which he held   
most precious — his religion. Backing up this assertion were all of   
the physical and emotional assaults of early imprisonment: the   
confusing but incriminating interrogations, the humiliating "strug-   

----------------------- Page 63-----------------------

gles," the painful and constricting chains, and the more direct phys-   
ical brutality. Dr. Vincent and Father Luca each began to lose his   
bearings on who and what he was, and where he stood in relation-   
ship to his fellows. Each felt his sense of self become amorphous   
and impotent and fall more and more under the control of its   
would-be remolders. Each was at one point willing to say (and to   
be) whatever his captors demanded.   
  
Each was reduced to something not fully human and yet not   
quite animal, no longer the adult and yet not quite the child;   
instead, an adult human was placed in the position of an infant   
or a sub-human animal, helplessly being manipulated by larger   
and stronger "adults" or "trainers." Placed in this regressive stance,   
each felt himself deprived of the power, mastery, and selfhood of   
adult existence.   
  
In both, an intense struggle began between the adult man and   
the child-animal which had been created, a struggle against regres-   
sion and dehumanization. But each attempt on the part of the   
prisoner to reassert his adult human identity and to express his own   
will ("I am not a spy. I am a doctor"; or "This must be a mistake.   
I am a priest, I am telling the truth" ) was considered a show of re-   
sistance and of "insincerity," and called forth new assaults.   
  
Not every prisoner was treated as severely as were Dr. Vincent   
and Father Luca, but each experienced similar external assaults   
leading to some form of inner surrender — a surrender of personal   
autonomy. This assault upon autonomy and identity even extended   
to the level of consciousness, so that men began to exist on a level   
  
68 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
which was neither sleep nor wakefulness, but rather an in-between   
hypnogogic state. In this state they were not only more readily in-   
fluenced, but they were also susceptible to destructive and aggressive   
impulses arising from within themselves. 3   
  
This undermining of identity is the stroke through which the   
prisoner "dies to the world," the prerequisite for all that follows.   
  
2. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GUILT   
  
Dr. Vincent and Father Luca found themselves unanimously   
condemned by an "infallible" environment. The message of guilt   
which they received was both existential (you are guilty!) and psy-   
chologically demanding (you must learn to feel guilty!). As this   
individual guilt potential was tapped, both men had no choice   
but to experience — first unconsciously and then consciously — a   
sense of evil. Both became so permeated by the atmosphere of guilt   
that external criminal accusations became merged with subjective   
feelings of sinfulness— of having done wrong. Feelings of resent-   
ment, which in such a situation could have been a source of strength,   

----------------------- Page 64-----------------------

were shortlived; they gave way to the gradual feeling that the punish-   
ment was deserved, that more was to be expected.   
  
In making their early false confessions, Dr. Vincent and Father   
Luca were beginning to accept the guilty role of the criminal.   
Gradually, a voice within them was made to say, ever more loudly:   
"It is my sinfulness, and not their injustice, which causes me to   
suffer — although I do not yet know the full measure of my guilt."   
  
At this point their guilt was still diffuse, a vague and yet per-   
vasive set of feelings which we may call a free-floating sense of guilt. 4   
Another prisoner expressed this clearly:   
  
What they tried to impress on you is a complex of guilt. The complex   
I had was that I was guilty. ... I was a criminal — that was my reel-   
ing, day and night.   
  
3. THE SELF-BETRAYAL   
  
The series of denunciations of friends and colleagues which both   
Dr. Vincent and Father Luca were required to make had special   
significance. Not only did making these accusations increase their   
feelings of guilt and shame, it put them in the position of subvert-   
ing the structures of their own lives. They were, in effect, being made   
  
PSYCHOLOGICAL STEPS   
  
to renounce the people, the organizations, and the standards of   
behavior which had formed the matrix of their previous existence.   
They were being forced to betray — not so much their friends and   
colleagues, as a vital core of themselves.   
  
This self-betrayal was extended through the pressures to "accept   
help" and in turn "help" others. Within the bizarre morality of   
the prison environment, the prisoner finds himself — almost without   
realizing it — violating many of his most sacred personal ethics   
and behavioral standards. The degree of violation is expanded, very   
early in the game, through the mechanism of shared betrayal, as   
another priest described:   
  
The cell chief kept asking information about Church activities. He   
wanted me to denounce others, and I didn't want to do this. ... A   
Chinese Father was transferred into the cell, and he said to me, "You   
cannot help it. You must make some denunciations. The things which   
the Communists know about any of your Church activities you must   
come out with." . . . Much later I was put in another cell to bring   
a French priest to confession. He had been stubborn, and had been in   
solitary for a few months. He was very fearful and looked like a wild   
animal. ... I took care of him, washed his clothes for him, helped   
him to rest. I advised him that what they might know he might as well   
confess.   
  

----------------------- Page 65-----------------------

Although there is a continuing tension between holding on and   
letting go, some degree of self-betrayal is quickly seen as a way   
to survival. But the more of one's self one is led to betray, the greater   
is one's involvement with his captors; for by these means they make   
contact with whatever similar tendencies already exist within the   
prisoner himself — with the doubts, antagonisms, and ambivalences   
which each of us carries beneath the surface of his loyalties. This   
bond of betrayal between prisoner and environment may develop   
to the point where it seems to him to be all he has to grasp; turning   
back becomes ever more difficult.   
  
4. THE BREAKING POINT: TOTAL CONFLICT AND THE BASIC FEAR   
  
Before long, Father Luca and Dr. Vincent found themselves at   
an absolute impasse with their environment. Each was looked   
upon not only as an enemy, but also as a man completely out of   
step. They were aware of being in painful disagreement with al-   
leged truths about their past, and yet at this point they were un-   
  
70 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
clear about what these "truths" were.   
  
At the same time, they had been impressed with the inflexibility   
of their milieu. The government, being infallible, would not give   
way; it was the "stubborn criminal" who had to "change." Their   
situation was like that of a man taken suddenly from his ordinary   
routine and placed in a hospital for the criminally insane, where he   
is accused of a horrendous but vague crime which he is expected   
to recognize and confess; where his assertion of innocence is   
viewed as a symptom of his disease, as a paranoid delusion; and   
where every other inmate-patient is wholly dedicated to the task   
of pressuring him into a confession and a "cure." 6 The sense of   
total reversal is like that of Alice after falling down the rabbit hole;   
but the weirdness of the experience is more that of a Kafka hero.   
  
The prisoner's dilemma leads him to a state of antagonistic es-   
trangement. He is not totally estranged from the environment, be-   
cause even antagonism is a form of contact; but he is totally cut off   
from the essential succor of affectionate communication and related-   
ness, without which he cannot survive. And at the same time, his   
increasing self-betrayal, sense of guilt, and his loss of identity all   
join to estrange him from himself — or at least from the self which   
he has known. He can contemplate the future with only hopeless-   
ness and dread. Literally and emotionally, there seems to be no   
escape from this hermetically-sealed antagonism.   
  
As the assaults continue, and as they are turned inward, he begins   
to experience one of the most primitive and painful emotions known   
to man, the fear of total annihilation. This basic fear 4 — considered   
by some the inherited forerunner of all human anxiety — becomes   
the final focus for all of the prison pressures. It is fed by every threat   

----------------------- Page 66-----------------------

and accusation from without, as well as by all of the destructive   
emotions stimulated within. The fear is compounded by the hor-   
rifying realization that the environment seems to be making it   
come true. Dr. Vincent did not only fear annihilation; he actually   
felt himself to be annihilated. It was this confirmation of a primitive   
fear which led him to hope for relief through quick death.   
  
This is the point at which physical and mental integration break   
down. Some prisoners may be brought by their severe anxiety and   
depression to the point of suicidal preoccupations and attempts:   
  
They scolded me in a nasty way. I had the feeling that everyone was   
cross with me and despised me. I thought, why do they despise me?   
  
PSYCHOLOGICAL STEPS 71   
  
What have I done? ... I was eating very little. ... I refused to eat   
or drink. ... I felt very much down. I felt there was no chance for   
me. ... It was so utterly hopeless. For six weeks I did nothing but   
think how I might kill myself.   
  
Others experience the delusions and hallucinations usually as-   
sociated with psychosis:   
  
I heard investigations taking place below, and one day I heard my   
name called. I listened while Chinese were indoctrinated to testify   
how I had been gathering information on troop movements. . . . The   
next day I recognized the voice of my Chinese accountant who was   
told that I had confessed everything and therefore his confession better   
agree with mine. . . . Once I heard the guards saying in a social con-   
versation with a German that they would soften me up by locking me   
in a cage which used to be used by the KMT. ... I was near going   
nuts.   
  
Such symptoms are clear evidence of the loss of the capacity   
to cope with one's environment. At the same time, they represent   
— as do any psychiatric symptoms — protective efforts, attempts on   
the part of the human organism to ward off something perceived as   
an even greater danger: in these cases, the anticipation of total   
annihilation.   
  
Many of Father Luca's transient delusions represented just such   
a combination of breakdown and restitution. His imagining (and   
believing) that his consul was visiting the prison, or that he was   
once more among his fellow Christians, were evidence he had   
lost the ability to discriminate between the real and the unreal.   
But in experiencing these same delusions, the content of which re-   
inforced his fantasies of rescue, Father Luca was clinging tenaciously   
to his own life force, and at the same time warding off his basic   
fear. 7   
  
No prisoner, whatever his defenses, ever completely overcame this   

----------------------- Page 67-----------------------

fear of annihilation. It remained with each in greater or lesser degree   
throughout imprisonment, and in some cases for a long time after-   
ward. It was a constant inner reminder of the terrible predicament   
he might again be forced to face should he further displease his   
captors.   
  
At this point, the prisoner's immediate prospects appear to be   
physical illness, psychosis, or death. If his death is to remain sym-   
bolic — and psychic damage kept from progressing beyond the re-   
  
72 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
versible stage — some form of desperately needed relief must be   
supplied.   
  
5. USNIENCY AND OPPORTUNITY   
  
A sudden change in official attitude — the institution of leniency   
— supplies this relief. The unexpected show of kindness, usually   
occurring just when the prisoner is reaching his breaking point,   
breaks the impasse between him and the environment. He is per-   
mitted — even shown how — to achieve some degree of harmony   
with his outer world.   
  
"Leniency" does not mean that the milieu budges from any of its   
demands, or even from its standards of reality. It simply lets up on   
its pressures sufficiently for the prisoner to absorb its principles and   
adapt himself to them. When Dr. Vincent, after two months of   
imprisonment, suddenly encountered friendliness and consideration   
in place of chains and struggles, there was no cessation of the   
pressure for confession. In fact, the effect of leniency was to spur   
him on to greater confession efforts. He was able to make these   
efforts because his leniency was accompanied by guidance; he had   
a chance to learn and act upon what was expected of him. Father   
Luca had no such good fortune. He, too, after one month, was   
given a respite: the removal of chains and handcuffs and the op-   
portunity to sleep; but his was the unusual experience of leniency   
without guidance. He was willing to comply (his false confession   
was, among other things, a profound expression of compliance);   
but he was unable to find the desired approach. In his case, there-   
fore, a new impasse was created, which resulted in a brutal inter-   
ruption of his leniency.   
  
The timing and the setting of leniency Can be extremely dramatic,   
as it was for another priest.   
  
It was Christmas Day. I was brought to see the judge. For the first   
time I found the room full of sunlight. There was no guard and there   
were no secretaries. There were only the kind faces of the judges offer-   
ing me cigarettes and tea. It was a conversation more than a question-   
ing. My mother could not have been much more good and kind than   
the judge was. He said to me, "The treatment you have received here   

----------------------- Page 68-----------------------

is really too bad. Maybe you are unable to stand it. As a foreigner and   
a priest, you must be used to good food and better hygienic standards.   
So just make a confession. But make it really good, so we can be satis-   
fied. Then we will close your trial and finish your case."   
  
PSYCHOLOGICAL STEPS 73   
  
In other cases, leniency was utilized to confront the prisoner   
with a threatening life-or-death alternative. It might include a   
new "good" interrogator who replaces or alternates with the "bad"   
one:   
  
An inspector had talked to me nastily and I collapsed. Soon after,   
a nicer inspector came to visit me. He was worried — very friendly to   
me — and asked me if I had heart disease. ... He said, "Your health   
is not good; you must have a better room." He called on me again and   
said, "We must get your case settled now. The government is interested   
in you. All you must do is change your mind. There are only two ways   
for you to go: one way leads to life, and the other to death. If you   
want the road that leads to life, you must take our way. You must re-   
form yourself and re-educate yourself." I said, "That sounds very good."   
I felt light of heart and told the other cellmates about it. They said,   
"That's good. Write your confession about how wrong your old political   
ideas were, and how willing you are to change your mind — and then   
you will be released."   
  
This threat also was clear in the experience of another prisoner   
who had been transferred to a hospital after an attempt at suicide:   
  
At first they told me that I had tried to kill myself because I had a   
bad conscience. . . • But the doctor seemed very kind. . . . Then an   
official came to see me and he spoke to me in a very friendly voice:   
"The government doesn't want to kill you. It wants to reform you. We   
don't want to punish you at all, we just want to re-educate you." . . .   
It was my first glimmer of hope. I felt finally there might be a way out.   
I wasn't feeling so hopelessly alone any more. The official had actually   
shown some human quality. 8   
  
Apparent in all these examples is the immense stimulus which   
leniency provides for the prisoner's reform effort. Total annihila-   
tion is no longer all he can visualize. He has been offered rest, kind-   
ness, and a glimpse of the Promised Land of renewed identity and   
acceptance — even freedom; annihilation is now something he can   
avoid, and in fact must avoid at all costs.   
  
The psychological decompression of his environment serves to   
win him over to the reform camp, especially to that part of the   
reform camp which is working on him. In other words, he becomes   
motivated to help the officials achieve what they are trying to do   
to him. He becomes, as did Dr. Vincent, their grateful partner in   
his own reform.

6. THE COMPULSION TO CONFESS '   
  
Long before any suggestion of leniency, Father Luca and Dr.   
Vincent had perceived the dominant message of their milieu: only   
those who confess can survive. Indeed, everything in the way of   
assaults and leniency — all pressures of breakdown and promised   
restitution — served to reinforce this message. In such a climate, the   
two men had no choice but to join in the universal compulsion   
to confess. Their first expression of this compulsion was the early   
elaboration of false "crimes." Even when a prisoner was aware that   
his confession was "wild" — as was Dr. Vincent — he had begun to   
submit to the confession requirement, and to behave as if he were   
a criminal. This was even more true, and the guilt even more pro-   
found, for those who, like Father Luca, came to believe in their own   
falsehoods.   
  
These first confessions are preliminary (although prison officials   
do not necessarily mean them to be such) to the main manifestation   
of the compulsion to confess — the total soul purge. Both Dr. Vin-   
cent and Father Luca, when their false confessions were rejected,   
hit upon the expedient of simply confessing everything, with spe-   
cial emphasis on what might be considered most sinful. In doing   
so, they moved beyond mere playing of the criminal role. They   
were beginning to accept as valid parts of themselves the two basic   
identities of thought reform.   
  
The first of these is the identity of the repentant sinner. The   
prisoner in effect says: "I must locate this evil part of me, this   
mental abscess, and excise it from my very being, lest it remain to   
cause me more harm." This leads directly to the second identity   
— that of the receptive criminal, the man who is, at whatever level   
of consciousness, not only beginning to concur in the environment's   
legal and moral judgment of him, but also to commit himself to   
acquiring the beliefs, values, and identities officially considered de-   
sirable. The acceptance of these two identities led both Dr. Vin-   
cent and Father Luca to express the idea that one had to get rid   
of old thoughts and emotions in order to make room for the new   
ones. Precisely this compulsion to reveal everything provides the   
continuity between breakdown and restitution, between confession   
and reform.   
  
The compulsion to confess is not static; it continually gathers   
  
PSYCHOLOGICAL STEPS 75   
  
momentum, and provokes an increasing sense of submission — as   
described by another priest:   
  
After a while one wants to talk . . . they press you, so you feel you   
must say something. Once you start you are deceived: you are at the   

----------------------- Page 70-----------------------

top of the tree and you go down. ... If you say the first word, there   
is always something more: "Lao shift" — No, no, be a good boy I Say the   
truth! — , "(an pai" — Confess! — are constantly repeated every two min-   
utes. I felt myself wanting to say more to make him shut his mouth, he   
was so insisting. ... It made me weak; it made me want to give in.   
  
Equally important, as both Dr. Vincent and Father Luca dis-   
covered, is the "creative" participation which each prisoner develops   
in his confession process. His inner fantasies must always make con-   
tact with the demands from without. To be sure, these fantasies   
are painstakingly and selectively molded by officials and cellmates.   
But they are never entirely divorced from the man who produces   
them. This means that a good deal of the energy involved in the   
confession comes from within the prisoner himself. His compul-   
sion to confess dedicates him to the task of continuously carving out   
and refilling his own inner void — under the active supervision and   
broad moral guidance of his captors.   
  
J. THE CHANNELLING OF GUILT   
  
Once the compulsion to confess is operating, the prisoner is   
ready to learn a more precise formula — thought reform's conceptual   
framework for his expression of guilt and repentance. By adopting   
the "people's standpoint," he channels nonspecific feelings of guilt   
into a paranoid, pseudo-logical system. His sense of evil, formerly   
vague and free-floating, is now made to do specific work for reform.   
He takes this step, as Vincent so clearly described, by learning to   
see evidence of personal evil and destructiveness in specific past   
actions. What was most prosaic, or even generous, must now be   
viewed as "criminal."   
  
This reinterpretation of events, as absurd as it may sound, has   
a strong impact because it stimulates forces within the prisoner   
himself which support the contentions of his environment. He has,   
like everyone else, struggled with feelings of curiosity, hostility,   
and vindictiveness not acceptable for public display, but retained   
as part of his own secret world. Now the awareness of these feel-   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
ings within himself, and especially of the secretiveness which ac-   
companies them, makes him feel like the "spy" he is accused of   
being. It is a relatively easy step foi him to associate this image of   
himself as a conspirator with the past events under consideration.   
Indeed, in making a casual comment about approaching Commu-   
nist armies, one part of him might really have hoped that this in-   
formation would reach and benefit the other side; and even if this   
were not true, it becomes fairly easy for him to imagine that it   
had been.   
  
Since the people's standpoint is an ultimate statement of bias,   
its acceptance also involves a basic negative commitment. The pris-   

----------------------- Page 71-----------------------

oner joins in condemning himself less for what he has done than   
for what he has been: as a Westerner — and therefore an "imperial-   
ist" — he is guilty. For him, this is the real significance of the people's   
standpoint, and its use of news, information, and intelligence is   
merely a method of implementing its prejudgment.   
  
The more the prisoner submits to these black-and-white judg-   
ments, the more he surrenders all that is subtle or qualified — as an-   
other missionary described:   
  
At first I was always making this distinction: as far as my conscience   
is concerned, it is no sin, but from their point of view it is a crime.   
I knew that the judgment would be standing on their point of view.   
. . . The same action was seen by me and them from a completely   
different morality — seen through a different window. They are looking   
through from the outside in, me from the inside out. . . . They said   
the government is infallible, so what it discovered cannot be untrue.   
That puts me in a bad position. I said, "I admit the government is   
infallible." They took my words like rubber. . . . Later I asked the   
government for a lenient sentence. I could not say that they were un-   
just, as I was standing on their point of view.    
  
As the prisoner accepts this "higher" group morality, its most harsh   
judgments make common cause with the most tyrannical parts    
of his own conscience; through this joining of forces, he is changed   
from a man who merely feels guilty into one who feels guilty about   
exactly those actions which the environment considers criminal.   
  
8. RE-EDUCATION: LOGICAL DISHONORING   
  
While Father Luca and Dr. Vincent, in a general sense, began   
their re-education the moment they were imprisoned, its formal   
  
PSYCHOLOGICAL STEPS J]   
  
inception occurred with the stress upon group study (hsileh hsi)   
just after the institution of leniency. Both men found that it was    
not Communist doctrine per se which mattered, but rather the   
use of Communist doctrine and its reasoning techniques to broaden   
their own self-exposure.   
  
It was no longer enough to admit guilt, to feel guilty, or even   
to recognize specific guilty actions. The prisoner had to extend   
his self-condemnation to every aspect of his being, and learn to   
see his life as a series of shameful and evil acts — shameful and evil   
not only in their possible opposition to Communism, but also   
because they violated his own cherished ideals.   
  
With Father Luca, this desecration of identity took the form of   
convincing him that he and his missionary colleagues had been "un-   
christian" in their conduct in China. Personal dishonoring of this   
kind was applied to both priests and laymen. It is illustrated in the   

----------------------- Page 72-----------------------

following exchange between another priest and his prison instructor:   
  
Instructor: "Do you believe man should serve others?"   
Priest: "Yes, of course I do."   
  
Instructor: "Are you familiar with the Biblical saying, 'I come on earth   
  
to serve, not to be served?' "   
Priest: "Yes, as a priest it is my creed."   
Instructor: "Did you have a servant in your mission?"   
Priest: "Yes, I did."   
  
Instructor: "Who made your bed in the morning and swept the floor?"   
Priest: "My servant did this."   
  
Instructor: "You did not live up to your doctrine very well, did you,   
Father?"   
  
This same priest explained the process of logical dishonoring in   
Marxist terminology and with a good deal of psychological insight:   
  
They believe that in each person there is a thesis — his positive ele-   
ment, work, or creed; and an antithesis — his weakness which works   
against this. The thesis in my case was the Catholic and my missionary   
work. My antithesis was anything which worked against this due to my   
personal shortcomings. The Communists attempted to wear down my   
thesis and encouraged the development of my antithesis. By making   
the antithesis stronger and the thesis weaker, they seek to have the   
antithesis replace the thesis as the dominant force in the individual.   
  
The antithesis of which the priest speaks is his negative iden-   
tity 10 — that part of him which he has been constantly warned

never to become. A priest's negative identity is likely to include   
such elements as the selfish man, the sinner, the proud man, the   
insincere man, and the unvigilant man. As the reformers encourage   
a prisoner's negative identity to enlarge and luxuriate, the prisoner   
becomes ready to doubt the more affirmative self-image (diligent   
priest, considerate healer, tolerant teacher) which he had previ-   
ously looked upon as his true identity. He finds an ever-expanding   
part of himself falling into dishonor in his own eyes.   
  
At this point the prisoner faces the most dangerous part of   
thought reform. He experiences guilt and shame much more pro-   
found and much more threatening to his inner integrity than any   
experienced in relation to previous psychological steps. He is con-   
fronted with his human limitations, with the contrast between what   
he is and what he would be. His emotion may be called true or   
genuine guilt, or true shame — or existential guilt 11 — to distinguish it   
from the less profound and more synthetic forms of inner ex-   

----------------------- Page 73-----------------------

perience. He undergoes a self-exposure which is on the border of   
guilt and shame. Under attack is the deepest meaning of his en-   
tire life, the morality of his relationship to mankind. The one-sided   
exploitation of existential guilt is thought reform's trump card, and   
perhaps its most important source of emotional influence over its   
participants. Revolving around it are issues most decisive to thought   
reform's outcome.   
  
Why call this process logical dishonoring? Surely it is not logical   
to have one's identity so disparaged — unless one sees this disparage-   
ment as a small but necessary part of a greater system of events.   
And this is precisely the kind of systematic rationale which the   
Communists — through their ideology — supply. A prisoner's incon-   
sistencies and evildoings are related to historical forces, political hap-   
penings, and economic trends. Thus, his acceptance of his negative   
identity and the learning of Communist doctrine become insepa-   
rable, one completely dependent upon the other. The realignment   
of affirmation and negation within one's identity requires an end-   
less repetition, a continuous application of self to the doctrine —   
and indeed, this is the essence of re-education. The prisoner must,   
like a man under special psychological treatment, analyze the causes   
of his deficiencies, work through his resistances (or "thought prob-   
lems") until he thinks and feels in terms of the doctrinal truths   
to which all of life is reduced. In the process, he may be guided   
  
PSYCHOLOGICAL STEPS 79   
  
by a particular "instructor" (sometimes referred to as "analyst"   
or "case analyst") who has special charge of his case, keeps all   
personal records, and conducts many individual interviews with   
him. The prisoner's psychological strengths and weaknesses become   
well known to his personal instructor, then to other officials as   
well, and are effectively utilized in the undermining process.   
  
What we have said so far of "re-education" hardly lives up to   
the name: we have talked more of breakdown than of remaking.   
In actuality, the remaking is also well under way. Even during the   
earlier stages of identity assault and compulsion to confess, the   
prisoner experiences stirrings of restitution. The buildup of his   
negative identity, along with his developing acceptance of Com-   
munist doctrine, provide the first contours of something new. He   
continues, during the years of imprisonment, to loudly proclaim his   
own demise; but as his re-education proceeds, he finds himself first   
announcing, and then experiencing, the refashioned identity which   
is emerging. His sense of nakedness and vulnerability nourishes   
the growth of the "new man."   
  
9. PROGRESS AND HARMONY   
  
The prisoner's new self requires emotional nutriment if it is to   
continue to develop. This nutriment is supplied by the prisoner's   
achieving a sense of harmony with his no-longer-strange surround-   

----------------------- Page 74-----------------------

ings. Harmony is partly a matter of gradual adaptation, as both   
Dr. Vincent and Father Luca made clear. Adaptation in turn is   
contingent upon progress in reform; and only when this progress   
has been demonstrated does the prisoner begin to receive the rec-   
ognition and acceptance which is so precious in such an environ-   
ment.   
  
Then, as Dr. Vincent described, the prisoner can experience the   
deep satisfactions of solving all problems; of group intimacy in   
living, working, and suffering; of surrendering himself to an all-   
powerful force, and sharing its strength; of laying himself bare in   
the catharsis of personal confession; of sharing the moral righteous-   
ness of a great crusade of mass redemption.   
  
Toward the end of their imprisonment, both Dr. Vincent and   
Father Luca were living under quite comfortable circumstances.   
The improvement in their physical surroundings was important   
enough; the atmosphere of frankness and of being met halfway was   
  
80 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
exhilarating. Both had regained the status of being human. Talks   
with judges were man-to-man encounters between people who un-   
derstood each other and considered one another's feelings. Indeed,   
Father Luca felt free enough to voice doubts and criticisms; and   
although he did this partially as a tactic, he was at the same time   
accepting therapeutic assistance from his captors.   
  
To appreciate the emotional appeal of harmony, one must — as   
the prisoner invariably does— contrast it with the basic fear and   
estrangement of the earlier phases of imprisonment. Instead of an-   
tagonism and total conflict, he feels in step with a milieu which ap-   
preciates him. Identified as a "progressive," he is permitted (and   
grasps at) a more direct form of self-expression. To be sure, he is   
still partly the actor; but performance and life have moved closer   
together, and he is not acting as much as he thinks he is. As he   
achieves a more intimate communication with his reformers, his   
entire experience takes on a much greater feeling of reality. Officials   
in turn show a beginning willingness to accept the prisoner as he is   
— by no means perfect in his reform, but at least more genuine in   
his partial reform.   
  
10. final confession: the summing up   
  
In this atmosphere of harmony and reality, the prisoner is ready   
to make a conclusive statement of what he is and what he has been.   
The confession has long been developing, of course, but it is likely   
to take its final shape only after he has achieved sufficient "progress"   
to produce and believe in a "correct" version.   
  
In Father Luca's case — which is especially illustrative for the   
entire confession process — the two short paragraphs of his final   

----------------------- Page 75-----------------------

confession seem almost anticlimactic after the millions of self-   
accusatory words he had already poured out. Yet this briefest of   
confessions was both a symbol and a summation of all that had   
gone before. For the officials, it was the confession, the statement   
for the record. For Father Luca, it was the last of an arduous series   
of confession identities. To understand this, we must review the   
sequence of his confession responses and his existential involve-   
ments, since any confession, whether true or false, contains an in-   
terpretation of one's present and past relationship to the world.   
  
Luca's first confession statement (so unacceptable as a confession   
that it might better be called his pre-confession statement) was his   
  
PSYCHOLOGICAL STEPS 8l   
  
defiance. In claiming that his arrest was either a mistake or a con-   
sequence of his faith, he was clinging to the identity of the priest   
with integrity. But as he began to surrender more and more of this   
part of himself, and became lost in the labyrinth of his own false   
confessions, he took on two additional identities: the secret con-   
spirator and the "novelist," or creative confabulator. His belief in   
his own falsehoods indicated both the degree to which his identity   
had broken down and the strength of the image created within him   
of this conspiratorial self. When he consented to speak about his   
clerical colleagues, and give details about Catholic groups, he was   
assuming the imposed identity of the betrayer, and especially the   
self-betrayer. Then, when the "novel" was abandoned, and he began   
for the first time to confess everything — to lay before his reformers   
all that came to his mind— he became the ignorant supplicant,   
groping for acceptance. Next, in organizing specific points in an   
acceptably self-damning fashion, he was simultaneously the re-   
pentant sinner (he could be repentant because he knew better   
what his sins were) and the relatively advanced confessor (one who   
had learned the techniques of his environment). In the two para-   
graphs of his final confession — in which he referred to his "espi-   
onage" relationship with another priest, and to his "illegal" church   
activities — he took on (although hardly completely) the final   
identity of the "confirmed" criminal.   
  
The reformers thus ended precisely where they had begun. From   
the beginning they had labelled Luca a criminal; and these two   
"crimes" were clearly the ones they had originally selected for him   
to "recognize." Why, then, did they put everyone to so much   
trouble?   
  
They did so because confession is as much a part of re-education   
as re-education is of confession. The officials demanded that their   
accusations become the prisoner's seZ/-accusations, and that the   
confession be made with inner conviction. They required that he   
present himself in the evil image they had constructed for him — and   
their reasons for requiring this, as we shall later discuss, are by no   
means completely rational.   

----------------------- Page 76-----------------------

  
Father Luca's sequence of confession was neither unique nor   
accidental; the sequence was essentially the same for Dr. Vincent   
also, and for almost all other prisoners. There is first the at-   
tempt at accuracy, then the wild confession, then the return to   
  
82 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
real events in distorted focus, and finally, the brief "criminal" con-   
fession. Since the development of the wild confession usually occurs   
during the first few days or weeks (Father Luca's lasted for an   
exceptionally long time), the main trend is a shift from the im-   
aginary to the concrete. Although fantasy and falsehood are by no   
means eliminated, this shift does give the prisoner the sense that he   
is moving in the direction of truth. His confession changes from   
an uncontrolled dream-like (or nightmarish) vision to a more re-   
sponsible reinterpretation of his own life. Thus he becomes more   
"engaged" in the confession process, more closely bound to his own   
words. At the same time, the effect of his wild confession has not   
been entirely lost upon him; he is apt to retain feelings of guilt over   
it, as if he had really done the things he described.   
  
While each step in the confession is the result of changes in the   
strength and tone of the environmental pressures, the prisoner   
experiences many of his responses as personal discoveries. Both   
Luca and Vincent, in shifting from falsehood to exaggeration,   
thought they had hit upon a useful and ingenious technique; only   
later did each realize that the officials' manipulations had made   
this reaction inevitable. Each step in the confession, then, is a   
means of adaptation; and it is also, for both prisoner and reformer,   
a compromise: he wishes to say less, and they demand more.   
  
In this confession sequence, there is a good deal of structuring   
and planning on the part of prison officials. But they too can be   
victimized by their impulses, and by the contagious paranoid tones   
of the environment; their confusion over what is true and what is   
false — so evident in their treatment of Father Luca — can add to   
this general emotional turmoil.   
  
The confession thus embodies demand and response, molded   
creativity, adaptation, compromise, working through, and a good   
deal of confusion on all sides. Its final version is the prisoner's   
subjective perception of the environment's message, guided by his   
reformers, but also including his own guilty re-evaluation of his   
past actions. Its beginnings in real events, the "logic" of its distor-   
tions, and its documented flavor may make it quite believable —   
both to the outside world and to its creator as well.   
  
11. REBIRTH   
  
Just before his release Dr. Vincent became once more the   
physician and teacher, and at the same time he became the ad-   

----------------------- Page 77-----------------------

  
PSYCHOLOGICAL STEPS   
  
vanced and sympathetic student of Chinese Communism. At the   
end, reformers made it clear he should combine these two aspects   
of himself. He was expected to bring the scientific and technical   
emphasis of his profession to his study of Communism, and to   
carry over a "progressive" approach (pedagogical shortcuts geared   
to the needs of "the people" ) to his medical teaching.   
  
The same principle was applied to Father Luca. Toward the end   
of his imprisonment he was more and more recognized as a priest   
with the right to hold his religious views, even if the officials would   
not go so far as to allow him to practice his religion — an enemy   
ideology — in the prison. Simultaneously he reached a stage of   
maximum participation in the Communist movement. This com-   
bination is best symbolized in his assuming the role of the re-   
former, working on a Chinese Catholic priest to bring him to con-   
fession. The foreign European missionary who had helped to train   
Chinese colleagues was once more taking the role of the spiritual   
mentor, but this time under the imposed sponsorship of the   
Chinese Communist movement which now encompassed them   
both.   
  
They did not cease to be priest or physician; rather each became   
a priest or physician sympathetic to, or at least in a working   
relationship with, Chinese Communism. Although much of their   
former identities had been dishonored during imprisonment, they   
had suffered only a temporary, controlled, and partial "death." If   
anything like a whole man is to walk out of prison, a good deal of   
the prisoner's old self will have to be resurrected. This resurrection,   
however, can be permitted only when the imposed thought reform   
elements are strong enough to dominate the new combination. For   
it is just this confluence of identities — the bringing together of evil   
criminal, repentant sinner, student of Communist doctrine, and   
the man originally imprisoned — which constitutes the rebirth.   
Heralded by all of the identity shifts of previous steps, this con-   
fluence is likely to occur only after prolonged re-education. And   
since even the prison identities must be carved out of the prisoner's   
own emotions (albeit with a powerful knife), rebirth means a   
basic modification, but not a total replacement, of the former self.   
  
It is a modification strong enough, as in the case of Dr. Vincent,   
to create a profound change in the prisoner's view of the world,   
and in his personal relationship to the world. He reinterprets his   
thought and behavior, shifts his values, recodes his sense of   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
reality. 12 The Communist world, formerly considered aggressive   
and totalitarian, is now seen as peace-loving and democratic. He   
identifies with his captors, and is happy in his faith.   

----------------------- Page 78-----------------------

  
12. release: transition and umbo   
  
At this point, the prisoner is ready for release, although the   
actual timing of a Westerner's release has been determined more   
by international political considerations than by his progress in   
reform. In recent cases, a public trial, replete with prosecuting and   
defense attorneys, has formalized both the conviction and the re-   
birth. Before an outside audience, the prisoner once more admits   
his crimes and expresses his new point of view, while the defense   
attorney makes a plea for additional "leniency." More frequently,   
the prisoner is simply read his charge and sentence while still within   
the prison, as happened to both Vincent and Luca. On rare oc-   
casions, a Westerner is sentenced to serve additional time in a   
new setting (considered a true prison) where he undergoes "reform   
by labor," a procedure of much less emotional involvement.   
Whether publicly or privately sentenced, the great majority of   
Western prisoners have been immediately expelled from China.   
  
But release and expulsion, as Vincent in particular discovered, do   
not put an end to one's troubles. Instead they thrust the Westerner   
into an environment which immediately questions all that has been   
so painstakingly built up during the years of imprisonment; and   
they precipitate a new identity crisis just as severe as the one ex-   
perienced during incarceration. Although this crisis occurs outside   
the thought reform milieu, it must be regarded as the final "step"   
in reform; it cannot be separated from what has gone before. The   
presence of this post-release identity crisis in virtually all of my   
Western subjects during the time of our interviews was what   
enabled them to describe so vividly the identity conflicts of their   
thought reform experiences.   
  
Upon arriving in Hong Kong, Dr. Vincent discovered that what   
he had become in prison was of absolutely no use to him in his   
new milieu. Alone with his emotions, he found himself in a dev-   
astating predicament: he had internalized enough of his prison   
environment to feel a severe distrust of the non-Communist world,   
but was sufficiently receptive to the evidence around him to be   
highly suspicious of the Communist point of view as well. The   
  
PSYCHOLOGICAL STEPS 85   
  
security he had known during the latter part of imprisonment sud-   
denly vanished, and his identity was shaken to its foundations.   
Should he still be the "Communist physician" of his rebirth and   
seek employment through a European Communist party? or   
should he return to his freelance medical work in underdeveloped   
countries? In his personal limbo he was unable to feel "safe" (or   
whole) in either world; instead he felt deceived by both.   
  
He longed nostalgically for the relatively simple, ordered, and   
meaningful prison experience, now glorified in his memory. He   

----------------------- Page 79-----------------------

could relinquish this longing only as he began to be able to trust   
his new environment; this trust in turn depended upon the capacity   
to trust himself. Once more he underwent a painful identity shift,   
encompassing what he had been before, what he had become in   
prison, and what he was in the process of becoming after release.   
  
Father Luca experienced a similar crisis, in some ways attenuated   
by his immediate welcome into the motherly embrace of the   
Church. He knew clearly that he was still the dedicated Catholic   
priest (although it was not easy for him to give up being a   
"Chinese" Catholic priest). But he retained profound doubts about   
his own integrity, and especially about the morality of his mis-   
sionary work. The dishonoring had struck deep chords in him, and   
had stirred strong anxieties. His problem was not so much whether   
or not to continue being a Catholic priest — he could conceive of no   
alternative to this — but rather one of regaining respect for the   
clerical missionary life to which he was committed.   
  
Nor were Dr. Vincent and Father Luca alone in these conflicts;   
immediately following release, all prisoners experienced profound   
struggles about their integrity, their ability to trust, and their search   
for wholeness. None escaped the personal crisis of this transitional   
period any more than he could avoid involvement in the other steps;   
but each man's crisis was his own.   
  
CHAPTER   
  
VARIETIES OF RESPONSE:   
  
THE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSED   
  
In discussing in Chapter 5 the twelve psychological   
steps of prison thought reform, I emphasized the   
similarities in the emotional responses of the people who were put   
through it. These similarities were due both to consistent pressures   
and to universal human characteristics. In this chapter, I shall turn   
to the equally important individual variations which I was able   
to observe. Each subject, during and immediately after his reform,   
demonstrated his own special combination of emotion and belief,   
his particular pattern of strengths and susceptibilities. The quality   
of this personal response depended largely upon the character traits   
of the man who was imprisoned, upon the configurations of emo-   
tions and identities developed within him during the course of his   
entire previous life.   
  
Since no two men are the same, we could delineate as many types   
of response as there were subjects interviewed. It is convenient,   
however, to distinguish three general categories, based upon the   
beliefs these men expressed and the emotions which underlay those   
beliefs at the time of our interviews. These categories — the ob-   
viously confused, the apparent converts, and the apparent resisters   
— each describe a broad style of response characteristic for the time   

----------------------- Page 80-----------------------

of imprisonment as well as for the post-release period. Despite the   
  
86   
  
THE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSED 87   
  
complexities involved, and the inevitable overlapping, these three   
categories allow us a deeper appreciation of both the inner effects of   
thought reform, and the relationship of these effects to already   
existing patterns of behavior.   
  
Dr. Vincent and Father Luca, as different as their reactions were,   
both exhibited the first and most frequent variety of response. Both   
felt confused and said so. Each could recognize that he had been   
affected by some of the Communist message, and each felt a need   
to reconsider the problems of who he was and what he believed.   
This combination of admitted confusion and conscious search was   
characteristic for fifteen of the twenty-five Westerners.   
  
Although I have said much about Dr. Vincent and Father Luca,   
I have included very little about the man behind the response or   
the child and youth behind the man. The following examination of   
their preprison life patterns makes obvious what psychiatrists and   
psychologists have learned to expect — that all men have a hidden   
history of struggle and conflict, whether they are patients or   
"normal" research subjects.   
  
Dr. Charles Vincent: The Mystical Healer   
  
Born and brought up in southern France in a pious, middle-   
class family (his father was a painter who limited his creations to   
Catholic religious art), Charles Vincent began to express during his   
earliest years an antagonistic urge to cut himself off from people   
around him:   
  
My father looked at me as a wild child. ... He was telling me all the   
time I didn't have any relationship with him. . . . We were in the   
same house but not in fusion. ... He didn't succeed to have my in-   
side. ... I thought, no matter what — you are wrong and I am right.   
  
Charles sought always to escape the confinement of his house:   
"I didn't like to sleep in a bed. I wanted to sleep in a tree." He re-   
members his father, on one occasion, chaining him to the house,   
but to no avail: "I succeeded in escaping and I was happy."   
  
His father felt that the best cure would be a strict boarding   
school. Charles attended four of these schools, most of which were   
run by Catholic authorities, between the ages of ten and seventeen.   
In each case he did well enough in his studies, but he recognized   
no rules, and kept himself emotionally aloof.   
  
88 THOUGHT REFORM   

----------------------- Page 81-----------------------

  
It was difficult for me. ... my temperament was to go against every-   
body, to keep me tight with no external manifestations. ... I was   
not interested in people around me, you understand — just looking only    
my way — just wanting to be out because I thought that way I could    
be more independent — to put a distance between persons who might   
still influence my goings on.   
  
Vincent (with a certain pride) remembers school authorities   
complaining to his father: "Your son has been here for four years   
and we don't even know him." After a period of time, he was usually   
expelled.   
  
But through all this combat, he felt deep within him that he was   
bad and guilty and that they — his father and other strict authorities   
— were justified in punishing and seeking to reform him.   
  
I never fought with my father. He was a good man. He gave me a   
profession. If he used a strong way with me, I think he was right. . . .   
I felt, "My father is my father, and I cannot go against him." The   
fault was with my character, but I couldn't by myself correct myself.   
  
This pattern continued through his teens, with his father still   
his main antagonist. His mother was apparently also on the side of   
authority, but Vincent's evasiveness about her suggests that what-   
ever else they shared was either too intimate or too painful to be   
easily recalled or revealed.   
  
At the age of nineteen, his distorted emotional patterns reached   
a bizarre climax in his first encounter with love. Feeling enamored   
of a fourteen-year-old girl, he decided that "she must fall in love   
with me," but he neither made physical advances nor even spoke   
of his feelings. Instead, he studied an anatomy book to find out   
where on his body he could shoot himself without causing perma-   
nent damage, took his father's pistol, and put a bullet through his   
shoulder. In telling me about this, he showed me his scar. Just be-   
fore shooting himself, he sent the girl a one-sentence note, telling   
her what he was about to do, and ending with the phrase, "only   
you cut my youth." He told me that he had done all of this "be-   
cause I wanted this girl to know I was in love with her — to be   
moved." Vincent spent two months in a hospital recovering; and   
the incident appeared to have more effect upon his parents than   
upon the girl: "My father said it was a surprise for him, a surprise   
to my mother also, to everybody." He looked upon his actions as a   
necessity, the only possible course for a man of his character:   
  
THE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSED 89   
  
I realized I was foolish, but I had to go through my experience. If   
someone had said "You are foolish," I never would have agreed. I was   
sure that in this way she would have to have love for me. . . . From   
this example you can see how straight I was going through to my aim   

----------------------- Page 82-----------------------

through my personal experience. I never had a thought to touch the   
girl — to let her know I was interested in her. But only through myself,   
you see, I did it. I am the master of myself, and do what I want to   
myself.   
  
With this deed, Vincent was acting out his conflicts on many   
levels: he was getting even with his father and mother, and with   
all other authorities whom he "surprised"; he was substituting de-   
structiveness (actually self-destructiveness) for love or affection;   
and through this act of self-punishment, he was atoning for his   
guilt. But what is most remarkable is his need to experience — and   
to manipulate — all thought, feelings, and actions through the   
medium of his own body. Such extreme narcissism, and such   
bizarrely symbolic behavior are usually found only in people so cut   
off from other human beings as to be considered psychotic. Indeed,   
one might well have expected such a youth to become a psychiatric   
casualty, if not a ne'er-do-well or a criminal. Certainly his extreme   
self-absorption, his disregard of all social rules, and his destructive   
behavior toward others and toward himself did not seem to offer   
much promise for his assuming a place or a function in any society.   
  
Vincent had, during this stage of late adolescence, experienced a   
crisis precipitated by the conflict between his asocial style of re-   
maining the "master" of his own "insides," and a sudden urge   
toward intimacy with another human being. At this age, some form   
of identity crisis — of a struggle to achieve direction while suspended   
between the child of the past and the adult of the future — occurs   
in everyone; 1 but in Charles Vincent, it assumed dangerously   
pathological proportions.   
  
Yet a solution appeared, a means of directing his energies into

Charles embarked on the study of medicine, with a passion for his   
subject which almost totally consumed his intellect and his emo-   
tions. He worked night and day, first on the theoretical and then   
on the practical aspects of medical study; he devoted all his spare   
time to extra work in clinics, and he graduated at the top of his   
class at the age of twenty-six. This vocational (and nonideological)   
  
90 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
solution to his identity crisis supplied the anchor for a life threat-   
ened by dangerously disruptive emotions. He had undergone a   
personal "death and rebirth"; but in his mystical view, he saw it as   
a continuation rather than an interruption of his previous life:   
  
I always wanted to be a doctor. I thought, it is the best profession. To   
talk to me about engineering, law, means nothing — but to be a doctor   
— I liked it by instinct.

they embarked for China. Again acting both intuitively and de-   
cisively, he had responded to the lure which China held for   
Europeans and Americans during the first decades of the twentieth   
century. He had spoken to many returning missionaries, and had   
read many articles; he was excited by the challenge of the difficulties,   
and by the absence of hospitals, physicians, and even rudimentary   
sanitary conditions. This opportunity for lonely accomplishment   
and exaggerated autonomy was probably the strongest attraction   
for him:   
  
In my training I always liked to do things for myself, to do what is   
necessary. For a doctor to be master of himself is what the patient   
needs. ... I took to China my microscope, all of my books and equip-   
ment, and a small microtome so I could do everything for myself and   
be completely independent.   
  
China more than lived up to his expectations. As a much-needed   
physician in an alien setting, he was able to do useful work and at   
the same time live in his own idiosyncratic fashion. He worked   
with other doctors only at the beginning in order to learn some-   
thing about local conditions and about Chinese medical vocabulary.   
Then he developed a self-sufficient pattern of private practice and   
part-time employment with European governmental representatives;   
he had daily clinic hours and also made broad bacteriological sur-   
veys. For a while he did research at a large medical center, but he   
discontinued this when a paper of his was criticized and at the   
same time a distinguished scientist arrived from Europe: "The   
competition started, so I left." Once he considered accepting a   
tempting offer to head a large missionary hospital, but abruptly   
backed out of the arrangement as soon as he discovered a clause in   
  
THE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSED 91   
  
the contract saying that he would not be permitted to leave the   
hospital area without the permission of the Mother Superior.   
  
He maintained throughout his years in China an intensive absorp-   
tion' in_ his medical work, treating Chinese and foreigners of all   
walks of life. But he scrupulously avoided intimate personal rela-   
tionships with anyone, as he considered these a threat to his free-   
dom. "If I have a friend I have to invite him, and I don't like to be   
a slave to convenience." He much preferred such individual pursuits   
as writing, painting, and hunting. "Instead of going to a dinner   
party, I can go to the country. I was a man who knew a better   
place." As might be expected, other Westerners in Shanghai dis-   
liked Dr. Vincent, viewing him as strange and somehow evil.   
  
After the war he decided, because of past political affiliations (al-   
though never interested in politics, he had joined a French rightist   
party in his country for the practical advantages this then afforded   
him) to move his practice almost entirely into the country. He   
began to care for patients over a wide area — traveling by motor-   

----------------------- Page 84-----------------------

cycle, horsecart, mule, small boat, or on foot. He kept three separate   
clinics in the country, always choosing the sites so that they would   
be near hunting areas. He ignored real danger from troops of both   
sides during the Chinese Civil War, and pursued with impersonal   
mystical enthusiasm both his healing art and his communion with   
nature:   
  
I lost myself completely living this kind of life. In the early morning   
and in the evening I would fish and hunt. I would work all day, some-   
times traveling three hours to get to a patient, sometimes sleeping at his   
home. ... I enjoyed living with the patient because to me he was not   
just a case. . . . There was no other doctor, and I was giving life to    
plenty of patients. ... It was a necessity to see life in contact with   
poor people and with nature in order to have emotions — emotions   
which I can translate into writing and painting. . . . There was no   
man as happy as I.   
  
Dr. Vincent maintained a similar personal distance in his rela-   
tionships with his wife and children. He spent little time with them,   
referring to his wife as "a very nice woman" because "she never gave   
me any trouble and always respected my freedom." He arranged for   
his family to leave for Europe just before the Communist take-   
over in 1948. He had virtually lost contact with his mother and   
father.   
  
92 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
In 1949, with the new regime installed, he found his services   
more in demand in the city, where he again began to conduct   
most of his practice. He established what he considered to be good   
relations with a few Communist officials, treating them at his   
private clinic, and he thought that with so few foreign doctors re-   
maining, his future was "bright." He disregarded numerous warn-   
ings from his embassy advising him to leave because the situation   
was becoming dangerous. On one occasion, he did make reserva-   
tions to go; but he decided to cancel them, because "I felt that to   
stay was more in keeping with my character."   
  
An important feature of Dr. Vincent's pre-thought reform char-   
acter was his manner of combining extreme and potentially dis-   
ruptive emotional patterns from early childhood with techniques   
learned during young adult training to shape a highly personal   
and unusual style of life. It is true that a psychiatrist might well   
have noted prominent schizoid and paranoid character trends; to   
put it more simply, he was a man unable to love. Yet he had de-   
veloped a stable and workable identity as a mystical healer — a   
lonely adventurer, ever courting new dangers; an isolated seeker of   
high aesthetic values, ever replenishing his store of sensations; a   
magical manipulator who could master his environment only   
through maintaining his distance from other people.   
  
Incorporated in this self-image were three convictions which he   

----------------------- Page 85-----------------------

had been seeking to prove to himself almost from the day of his   
birth: I need no one. No one can have my insides. I transcend other   
mortals. To maintain these personal myths required ever-strenuous   
but ever-exhilarating efforts. He was always on guard against his   
own inner urges in the opposite direction: his tendencies to seek   
intimacy, work co-operatively, and rely upon other people. These   
social and co-operative urges were, ironically enough, his negative   
identity. He had to keep warding them off as dangers to his personal   
myths, and to his exaggerated sense of individual mastery which   
held together the entire configuration.   
  
Like anyone who rebels strongly, he carried with him, through   
identification, much of those people from whom he sought to   
free himself. He had become, like his father, an artist and some-   
thing of a tyrant. (What he took from his mother is less clear.)   
The powerful emotions he had expressed in his early defiance of   
authority also left him with strong feelings of guilt. His guilt feel-   
  
THE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSED 93   
  
ings were not obvious, and he may even have appeared to some as   
a man without a conscience. Instead, he suffered from a more   
repressed and potentially malignant sense of evil and need for   
punishment, which revealed itself only in disguised form: in his   
self-injury at nineteen, his courting of danger, and his remaining in   
China long after he had been warned to leave. But the life pattern   
of the mystical healer could, under most circumstances, keep these   
emotions under control.   
  
When Dr. Vincent was imprisoned, however, everything was sud-   
denly overturned: the manipulator was now being manipulated,   
the healer was considered "ill" and in need of "treatment," the   
aesthetic wanderer was thrown into a crowded dingy cell, the isolate   
was forced to lay himself bare before strangers. Nothing in his   
former identity seemed to fit the new circumstances.   
  
In making his wild confession, he did attempt to maintain his   
emotional distance and call his manipulative powers into play. A   
man without binding group loyalties or devotion to any shared set   
of truths, he cared little for the pros and cons of Communist   
ideology; his concern was to survive. But thought reform assaults   
very quickly undermined his efforts to maintain control and stay   
uninvolved; he was drawn — as all had to be — into an intimate   
world of personal relationships and of ceaseless self-probing.   
  
Under these circumstances, his personal myth of absolute in-   
dependence and superhuman self-mastery was exploded. He had   
no choice but to become emotionally engaged in a human society,   
perhaps for the first time in his life. This reversal of such a basic   
identity pattern was a mark of thought reform's power; but it was   
achieved only through the reformers' success in bringing out   
Vincent's long-buried strivings toward human involvement, strivings   

----------------------- Page 86-----------------------

which he had until then successfully denied. They had also made   
contact with his concealed guilt susceptibilities: as he was made   
to feel more and more guilty, he could surrender his precious isola-   
tion (indeed, he had to, as his flight from people had been one of   
the original sources of his guilt), and become more and more what   
the environment wished him to be.   
  
When this began to happen, he could call upon no broad beliefs   
and no social self to protect him. Dazzled by the sudden filling of a   
long-standing emotional void, he took on much of the coloring of   
his new milieu. He accepted, and by no means superficially, much   
  
94 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
of the ideology and many of the visions of Chinese Communism.   
For he was a man no less vulnerable to human influence than   
others; behind his lifelong avoidance of people was both a fear of   
and a desire for such influence.   
  
In his process of rebirth, much of his old identity could be drawn   
upon. He was able to find a new focus for his mysticism in the   
Communist version of "the people"; he could resume his manipula-   
tive healing in "helping" his cellmates ("the Communists, too,   
bind body and spirit," he told me); and he could make use of a   
"scientific methodology" which appealed to the more concrete and   
logical side of his character. His rebirth culminated in his re-   
emergence at the end of his reform as the teaching physician. He   
gave the impression that during the last part of imprisonment he   
had brought his new identity configuration into good working   
order; at the moment of release, he was in a fairly integrated state.   
  
When he was thrust into the Hong Kong environment, however,   
his new identity was in turn shattered. I have already described the   
identity crisis precipitated within him through his inability to trust   
himself in relationship to either the Communist or non-Com-   
munist world; this information about his background reveals why   
his crisis of trust was so extreme. What was most devastating to   
Vincent was his loss of the exaggerated sense of mastery, which he   
had always been able to call forth in a non-Communist environ-   
ment. Having functioned for so long on the assumption that he   
could trust nothing and no one outside of himself, the absence of   
this self-trust was crucial, and the paranoid psychosis which this   
personal faith had always warded off threatened to engulf him.   
  
He was, in fact, closer to psychosis after release than he had been   
during the worst assaults of imprisonment. True, it was during   
thought reform itself that he had been deprived of his self-mastery;   
but then he had been offered a workable identity configuration in   
return, along with a strong sense of order and a series of pressures   
so involving that his emotions were absorbed by the constant   
struggle to keep in step. In Hong Kong he faced a milieu which   
offered neither controls nor support; instead it presented a peculiar   

----------------------- Page 87-----------------------

combination of freedom, colonial flavor, inequalities, artificiality,   
and a certain tentativeness. To be deprived in such a place of his   
only dependable identity mechanism meant facing for the first   
time the full consequences of his loss — facing both outer chaos and   
  
THE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSED 95   
  
inner confusion.   
  
Consequently, Dr. Vincent showed a tendency to relapse into   
the identity of the repentant criminal, as, for instance, when he   
reacted to the Chinese businessman as an accusing judge. He also   
had the — to him — novel experience of suffering from, rather than   
thriving upon, loneliness. In his encounters with friends, casual   
acquaintances, and with me as well, he sought help in the struggle   
to regain his lost sense of integration and mastery. But he was ill-   
equipped for close relationships, both because of his oldest life   
patterns and because of his newly-magnified suspiciousness. He   
quickly sensed that hope lay, not in the imposed emotional patterns   
of thought reform, but rather in a reversion to what he was best   
equipped to be — the mystical healer.   
  
Once he was permanently removed from external thought reform   
pressures, this reversion was inevitable. The clearest evidence of his   
return to his old pattern of experiencing all of life through his own   
mind and body is expressed in the following extraordinary statement   
made during our final interview:   
  
What happens is strange — this experience is useful to me — because I   
proved everything in China ... to be in jail and to be accused is   
part of myself. ... It is difficult to explain. . . . Now I have had the   
experience of the reality of that world. I know what they do. . . . My   
mind is more enlarged.   
  
I know everything about them — how cruel they are — their different   
mind — their materialistic way to see things — their logic. . . . You   
cannot know — you cannot understand what the chains and the tou-   
cheng [struggle] mean — about the compulsion they use. ... I know   
everything about the step-by-step method ... it is the difference be-   
tween a man who studies anatomy in a book and a man who studies   
anatomy on the body.   
  
I can see the situation through my experience, a personal experience —   
physical and spiritual. Now if somebody said to go back to China, I   
would say no; without my experience, I would say I have to go back.   
  
Here are echoes of the youth who put a bullet through his own   
shoulder to express his love for a young girl: the experience must   
be his, or it is no experience at all. This basic core of character had   
survived parental criticism, strict Catholic schools, medical study,   
twenty years of life in China, and even thought reform itself.   
  

----------------------- Page 88-----------------------

Dr. Vincent's confusion and search was, on the whole, non-   
ideological. Communist and non-Communist beliefs were, as always,   
  
96 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
important to him only as they affected his immediate life experi-   
ence. Even his confusion about ideas, manifested in the jump from   
one side to the other, was mainly an involuntary emotional experi-   
ment, a form of identity testing. His search led inevitably back to   
that part of him he knew best. But the effect of the Communist   
view of the world and the thought reform identities which he had   
absorbed during his imprisonment cannot be completely dismissed.   
These remained within him as an alternative self, ready again to   
emerge — as they did during our interviews together — should he feel   
wronged or neglected during his future life in the non-Communist   
world.   
  
What about his statement that he had never "talked so frankly"   
as he had to me, and that this was an effect of his re-education? I   
think he answered this question in his last sentence: "I have a   
feeling I left part of myself in Hong Kong." This remark can be   
interpreted in more than one way. It contains the suggestion that   
through thought reform, he had learned to surrender his "insides,"   
and had therefore been able to reveal more of himself to me than   
he had to anyone before. But it implies also, and perhaps more im-   
portantly, that in leaving part of himself in Hong Kong, he was   
shedding one of his skins in order to free himself for what lay   
ahead. He was leaving behind the newest, least comfortable, and   
most expendable part of himself, the reformed man. He was aware   
that thought reform had taught him to "open" himself to others;   
but having done so, first in prison, and then with me in Hong   
Kong, he was bent upon unlearning his lesson.   
  
Anthony Luca: Liberal Father Confessor   
  
Father Luca's confusion and search took a very different form,   
influenced by his own special background and character. Born in   
East Africa, son of a prominent Italian colonial official, Anthony   
grew up with a dual allegiance. He was very much a European boy   
— living among "natives" he was made especially aware of this;   
but he was also a child of Africa. He spent nine of his first eleven   
years there; and when he was sent to live in Europe from the ages   
of seven to nine, he had longed for the freedom of "the land . . .   
the river ... a whole little world of our own" in Africa. An excel-   
lent student during his early years, his work suffered in Europe. But   
  
THE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSED 97   
  
more disturbing to him were his social difficulties there among the   
"rough and rather unpleasant" boys in his class, who spoke a kind   
of slang he could not understand. And when Anthony, without   
thinking, used the common language of Europeans in Africa —   

----------------------- Page 89-----------------------

African words mixed with- his own language — he was laughed at and   
teased. His companions, with the merciless psychological accuracy   
of schoolboys, summed up his conflict when they tauntingly dubbed   
him "the white Negro."   
  
His family relationships perpetuated this conflict, and also pre-   
sented him with an additional emotional duality. The family had in   
many ways a classical European constellation: a stern, strongly   
opinionated, "authoritarian" father; a less talked about, but more   
intimate mother; a "very reliable" older brother and a more erratic   
and attention-getting younger brother among Anthony's five   
siblings.   
  
His feelings toward his father alternated between fear and love,   
meeting in a common denominator of respect. He happily recalled   
the long walks which they took together in the open African   
countryside, during which his father would tell him informative   
and interesting stories and teach him the alphabet to prepare him   
for school. But his father also had a more frightening side, so that   
Anthony had a "double idea about him"; he was demanding and   
critical, and would frequently beat the boy for misbehaving. An-   
thony resented his father's tendency to "say what was wrong but   
not use many words of explanation or justification." Despite this   
conflict, he was deeply impressed with his father's "great sympathy   
for the black man," and his energetic defense of Africans in their   
conflict with Europeans.   
  
He received affection and solace from his mother, but he was   
troubled by her "nervousness" — and he sometimes felt that both   
of his parents neglected him in favor of their own cultural and intel-   
lectual interests. Despite these problems he deeply missed his   
parents when, on medical advice, he was sent to live with relatives   
in Europe because of the discovery of what was then diagnosed as   
a kidney ailment. Put on a closely-supervised medical and dietary   
regime, and beset by emotional conflicts, he at first felt weak and   
worthless: "I was little, had no strength, and the other boys   
despised me." But these feelings were soon overshadowed by a new   
pattern which quickly became a major concern — his "badness."   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
As a child in Africa, Anthony had an occasional show of temper   
and was considered to be a bit reckless, sometimes self-destructively   
so: he would experiment with his environment by putting dirt in   
his mouth "to see what it tasted like," or by running across the   
street just in front of an automobile "to see if I could run quickly   
enough." But later in Europe, feeling lonely and persecuted, he   
became more generally ill-tempered and disobedient; and a con-   
tinuing struggle with his aunt and uncle developed (or with his   
father during visits). The conflicts began with Anthony's mis-   
behavior, and ended either with his being sent to bed without din-   
ner, or, more frequently, with his being placed in the "black cellar,"   

----------------------- Page 90-----------------------

despite all his infuriated cries and kicks.   
  
This pattern diminished somewhat when he returned to Africa;   
but when he was in Europe during his teens — he had entered   
boarding school there at the age of eleven — his "badness" took   
another form, a disturbing new sexual awareness. He experienced   
anguished feelings of guilt and shame about his masturbation and   
his sexual interest in girls, and also in connection with a physical   
approach made to him by another young boy.   
  
After a while, he did begin to earn some respect in school be-   
cause of his fine grades, his rapid body growth, and his developing   
ability in sports; he made more friends and felt more accepted by   
others. But he was aware of a "contradiction" in his character, one   
which always remained with him: in his relations with other people   
he alternated between shyness and fear on the one hand, and   
overly assertive and dogmatic attitudes on the other.   
  
This "bad" (and sexually aware), "weak" (but athletically com-   
petent), able and intelligent, shy-domineering, "white Negro"   
adolescent sought some way to integrate these painfully unmeshed   
aspects of himself and become a person whom he and others could   
respect. He found it through religion, and specifically through the   
clerical ideology of the Catholic Church.   
  
He was embracing a doctrine which had always been available   
to him. As a son of "good" (although not fervent) Catholics, he   
had begun to attend Mass in Africa when still an infant and had   
been instructed there by missionary fathers. He had not, however,   
demonstrated a particularly strong interest in religion until the time   
of his troubled adolescence, when he began to seek comfort through   
long periods of prayer in the chapel of the dormitory (run by   
  
THE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSED 99   
  
Catholic fathers) where he was living. During the course of this   
inner search, he developed the conviction that his mother and father   
had not been sufficiently pious or serious in their lives. His resolve   
to follow a more purposeful existence carried him closer to an   
ideological solution of his identity crisis.   
  
It was something of thinking that there must be some great interest in   
life to help others — to have a lasting aim — a broader point of view   
that embraced the whole of things which could help people who under-   
went unpleasantness.   
  
At the age of fourteen he participated in a Catholic retreat   
supervised by one of the fathers — three-and-one-half days devoted   
to prayer and meditation, while completely withdrawn from   
worldly activities — which he considered a crucial interlude in his   
life. During the retreat, he thought a great deal about what he   
considered to be his two main faults — his sexual ideas (especially   

----------------------- Page 91-----------------------

the guilt accompanying masturbation) and his bad temper; he   
sought ways to overcome these and to "correct myself." His plans   
became more specific and affirmative: "I emerged with the resolve   
to be good, to be active in the world, to have an aim for religion."   
He dates his urge to enter the priesthood from this retreat; but at   
the time he told himself it would not be possible because he was   
too unworthy. At the age of sixteen he made his definite decision,   
strongly influenced by a young priest whom he greatly admired and   
who planned to do missionary work in China.   
  
Anthony was then certain that he too wished to become a mis-   
sionary, either in Africa or China. A schoolmate's interest in China   
and his friendship with Chinese Christian students played a part   
here. Like many European Christians of this period, he viewed   
China as the great missionary challenge: "I thought that what I   
could do best was to be a missionary in China . . . the biggest   
country ... the most people ... to be a parish priest was not   
so necessary."   
  
His family was not pleased with his decision. His father, whose   
aspirations for the boy included a brilliant and conventional career,   
particularly objected to his choosing a small, unknown missionary   
order rather than a famous society like the Jesuits. But Anthony   
succeeded in winning over his mother, who in turn combined forces   
with the seminary Superior to obtain reluctant agreement from her   
  
100 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
husband.   
  
During his six years of seminary training and theological study,   
the emphasis was upon "self-examination" and "internal dis-   
cipline." Anthony found it quite demanding, particularly since "I   
always had difficulty in exactly stating my feeling," but he felt   
that he profited from the training and had "good memories" of   
these years. He went on to take advanced theological studies, com-   
pleting a doctoral dissertation relating to the psychological aspects   
of faith; and he also did work in medicine and Buddhist philosophy   
to prepare him for his Asian missionary assignment.   
  
His departure was delayed by the war, and he remained in Europe   
for three additional years. He became involved with anti-Fascist   
underground activities, and worked closely with guerrilla forces.   
During this time he demonstrated unusual bravery, volunteering   
for dangerous missions, and on one occasion approaching unarmed   
a group of enemy deserters to convince them to give up their   
weapons. He attributed his lack of fear to his firm conviction that   
what he was doing was right; and he was widely praised for his   
courage.   
  
When he was finally sent to China, Father Luca was quickly   
enthusiastic and successful in his missionary work. He responded   

----------------------- Page 92-----------------------

strongly to the country, the language, and the people. He developed   
particular affection for the young Chinese he guided and taught,   
and they in turn regarded him with great respect and affection.   
But he was still troubled by the emotional problems which had   
plagued him since early adolescence. His sexual conflicts emerged   
in his experiencing "great affection" and "intimate feelings," on two   
occasions, for young secondary school girls with whom he was   
working; and his difficulties with authority came out in his frequent   
resistance to those above him, and his fluctuation between over-   
bearing and self-effacing attitudes. He continued, as in the past, to   
overcome these problems through meditation, prayer, and especially   
religious confession.   
  
But after the Communists took power, Father Luca found him-   
self in conflict with both the representatives of the new govern-   
ment and with many of his own colleagues. Much of his activity   
was devoted to organizing Chinese youth into the faith-propagat-   
ing Legion of Mary. The Legion, as well as all other religious   
organizations, was soon required to register with the new regime,   
  
THE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSED 101   
  
and it was bitterly criticized and constantly harassed because of   
its opposition to the regime's triple autonomy movement. At Com-   
munist mass meetings, the Legion of Mary was denounced as a   
"reactionary" organization devoted to "espionage," and Father Luca   
heard that on one such occasion he was publicly accused of incit-   
ing young boys in his youth groups to "sabotage" and to various   
forms of vandalism.   
  
Father Luca favored moderate behavior on the part of the Church   
in meeting this crisis. He especially opposed arbitrary attitudes of   
individual Catholic officials and was critical of those who indulged   
in political — and in some cases military — action against the Com-   
munists. He argued against the thesis that all Communists were   
evil per se, expressing the Christian point of view that they were   
human beings after all, sometimes guilty of wrongs, but capable   
of redemption. Father Luca felt strongly about the Church's need   
to find a means of surviving in China, and about his own personal   
desire to remain there and continue his missionary work. He re-   
peatedly ignored his colleagues' advice to leave despite what they   
considered to be his precarious personal position.   
  
The man who was imprisoned, then, was an effective and in-   
tegrated human being, one able to work and to love. Crucial to   
his identity was his sense of being a man of God, a representative   
of the Faith and of the Truth, a responsible official of the Catholic   
Church, a friend of the oppressed, a searching and open-minded   
scholar, a brother and father of Chinese youth, a lover of China   
and of the Chinese, and a foreign member of Chinese culture. But   
ever lurking in the background was another much more derogatory   
self-image, a view of himself as impure (sexually) and unhumble   

----------------------- Page 93-----------------------

(in his dealings with superiors). Also part of this negative identity,   
we suspect, were old feelings of weakness, as well as the fear of   
alienation from friends and colleagues. These negative and posi-   
tive elements were both included in his over-all identity of the   
liberal "Chinese'" father confessor.   
  
His liberalism was related to his past identity struggle: torn apart   
as a child by the conflict between his African and European selves,   
deeply attached and yet a bit unsteady in his family identifications,   
experimental and inquisitive since earliest childhood (even to the   
point of swallowing dirt), he had early learned to be receptive to   
  
102 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
the other person's convictions and way of life. With him, as with   
anyone truly receptive, this meant not just standing by with tol-   
erance, but actually becoming each of the things which challenged   
his sense of identity — whether African child, European schoolboy,   
or Catholic priest and missionary. Thus he became more "Chinese"   
than his colleagues, closer to and better loved by those whom he   
guided and instructed. At the same time, his capacity to under-   
stand and sympathetically enter into the other person's point of   
view made him more prone to moral conflict and indecisiveness.   
Such is likely to be the identity constellation and the dilemma of   
any "liberal," no matter what his cause.   
  
Priests have been called "father-confessor" since the Church's   
early days. For each priest this title has a shared as well as a special   
meaning; in Father Luca's case, it symbolizes much of his character.   
He was even more the "father" than the average priest, since almost   
all of his professional career had been devoted to work with young-   
sters, and he liked to do this work best. He was a "confessor" —   
as a priest, novice, naughty child (and later as a prisoner) — in   
all three meanings of the term: he made confessions, he heard con-   
fessions, and he also "avowed and adhered to his faith under perse-   
cution and torture without suffering martyrdom."   
  
Confession, then, had long been for him a personal style, even   
a way of life. It was not without its difficulties: the small boy was   
not always clear about what wrong he was expected to "confess";   
the novice could not easily express his exact feelings. Whatever in-   
articulate and repressive forces worked against it, however, con-   
fession had served him well. Through it he had been able to face,   
and share with sympathetic colleagues, the disturbing feelings which   
had fed his negative identity. It had been especially important in   
subduing (although never fully conquering) his sexual urges and   
aggressive tendencies.   
  
Nonetheless, the sense of evil which accompanied these sexual   
and aggressive urges could not easily be stilled. Confession helped   
to keep these feelings conscious and manageable (rather than in-   
accessible and more dangerous, as with Dr. Vincent); but it also   

----------------------- Page 94-----------------------

required him to search out his own evil, to look constantly upon   
himself as one who is guilty. His susceptibility to guilt, present   
from early life, was thus ever stimulated anew. Managed reasonably   
effectively by his tie to the Catholic Church, his guilt was a point   
  
THE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSED 103   
  
of vulnerability for any new authority which might seek to manipu-   
late his loyalties; it was, in fact, the royal road to his negative   
identity.   
  
Father Luca's complex adult configuration was largely the product   
of emotional compromise. In dealing with his father and all later   
authorities, he had alternated between submission and rebellion.   
He had, in a sense, defied his father in becoming a priest, and es-   
pecially in a small missionary order; but he was remaining within   
a Catholic ideology which his family held sacred. Moreover, he   
became, like his father, at the same time both a champion of the   
rights of "natives" and a loyal servant of a European institution.   
He also possessed a tenderness which — as his prison memories sug-   
gest — must have been derived from a relationship of love and in-   
timacy with his mother; a relationship which may have been   
responsible for much of his submissiveness, receptivity, and pen-   
chant for suffering.   
  
In his ideological solution to his identity crisis, Father Luca   
(unlike Dr. Vincent) acquired a comprehensive if constricting view   
of the world, and a strict code of conduct for relations with other   
people; he took on a sense of loyalty and near-total submission to   
an institution greater than himself. His concern was no longer   
simply, "Where do I stand?" and, "What can I do about my bad-   
ness?" Badness and commitment still had to be dealt with, but not   
on an individual basis. Instead, he asked himself, "How can I   
purify and humble myself in order to better serve the Church?   
How can I be more consistent in my life, and mean what I say   
and do? How can I, as a Catholic priest, be fully sincere?"   
  
It is therefore not surprising that Father Luca objected strenuously   
to the judge's impugning his sincerity. He stated his position at   
the beginning — "a mistake or a matter of religion" — which made   
him, as he stood before the judge, both a man defending truth and   
a representative of a sacred institution. The fact that he had doubts   
about his own sincerity, at whatever level of consciousness, made   
him fight all the harder: one does not reveal inner weakness before   
the enemy. Moreover, by this same initial statement, he had de-   
clared his imprisonment a test of his sincerity; he assumed the   
posture of the confessor who is the defender of his faith against   
those who would persecute it.   
  
The irony of his situation was that his reformers meant some-   
  
104 THOUGHT REFORM   

----------------------- Page 95-----------------------

  
thing a little different by "sincerity": for Chinese Communist of-   
ficials, both in prison and out, to be sincere is to yield to them as   
representatives of the Way and the Truth. "Insincerity" or resist-   
ance is the one attitude which they will not tolerate, and they re-   
garded Luca's behavior as provocative. This, plus their prior identifi-   
cation of him as an enemy — he was not only a Catholic priest, but   
a leader of a militant Catholic organization — led to their use of force   
and brutality to a degree unusual even for a Chinese Communist   
prison. As on earlier occasions in his life, Luca could not grasp or   
articulate what he was expected to confess; and although the re-   
former's contradictory demands may have been mainly responsible   
for this, it is very likely that Luca's lifelong resistances to confes-   
sion also played a part, as he seemed to have much more difficulty   
than most other prisoners in reaching an understanding of the situa-   
tion. In any case, he experienced a more profound physical and   
psychological breakdown than did Dr. Vincent.   
  
Father Luca's false confession reflected both a disintegration of   
his sense of reality and identity, and an outpouring of his sense of   
evil. His experience was like that of a man, who, troubled by feelings   
of guilt, dreams that he is a criminal being punished. Luca was   
a "criminal" being punished in jail, "dreaming" of having com-   
mitted the kind of crime of which he was accused — his dream   
work much assisted by his surroundings, and closely supervised by   
judge and cellmates. In a twilight state of fatigue, pain, and al -   
tered consciousness, he was both responding to the prison message   
and at the same time reverting to his own familiar confession idiom.   
  
No other prisoner I encountered confessed more extensively   
than did Father Luca; nor did anyone else sustain for as long a   
period such a grossly false story. He could do this and even believe   
in his confession, not only because the environment encouraged   
this belief, but also because his confession had for him the ring   
of psychological truth. That is, it expressed "subversive" things   
about himself, albeit in the language of the Communist police   
system rather than that of the Catholic Church. It was an extreme   
version — a caricature — of his own negative identity. As an expe-   
rienced confessor (and a man who had done some writing) Father   
Luca could be creative, prolific, and convincing in using this carica-   
ture to develop his confession-novel.   
  
The direct physical assault, coming at the height of the false con-   
  
THE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSED  105   
  
fession, showed a loss of control on the part of the Communist of-   
ficials. They had begun to check Father Luca's false confession, ap-   
parently after having believed a good deal of it, and had found it to   
be "insincere" beyond words — in both the conventional and their   
own special meaning of the term.   
  

----------------------- Page 96-----------------------

Luca himself, once injured (and physically punished), rose to   
impressive heights of courage and strength. He had given indica-   
tions of his will to survive even before the injury. His delusions   
had included fantasies of self-affirmation — of recovery, rescue, and   
return to priestly activities — along with elements of guilt. At that   
time, too, he could summon faith in the religious purpose of his   
suffering ("penance for my sins"). Crippled and helpless, he was   
able to reach more profoundly into his emotional being and remind   
himself of the most basic forms of trust he had known in the past:   
religious comradeship, earthly places, both beautiful and permanent,   
and most of all, sad songs which took him back to maternal love   
and tenderness. His identity collapse had been temporary; now he   
sought always to reaffirm that in himself which he most valued and   
could depend upon. And at the same time, he kept his inner ex-   
perience within his own religious idiom. His imprisonment was a   
continuation of his lifelong self -purification. His faith was a power-   
ful ally, one he would under no condition surrender: hence his dra-   
matic assertion that "to take off my religion it is necessary to take   
out my heart and to kill me" — both a statement of creed and a   
quashing of self-doubt.   
  
This very creed and his devotion to the Church behind it led   
to his greatest pain during reform. As a "liberal" he had already   
been in conflict with "illiberal" (and militaristic) colleagues, with   
whom he was now accused of conspiring. As a "liberal," he could   
also "feel" the validity of some Communist objections to official   
and nonofficial Church activity. He was especially vulnerable to   
accusations that the Church did such apparently "good" things as   
helping the sick and poor for its own selfish reasons: this would   
be "insincerity" at its worst. But he was susceptible not only be-   
cause he was liberal; it was precisely in this issue that he found his   
guilt, both personal and existential, most exploited. A negative image   
here— of self and Church — was both intolerable and unavoidable.   
  
Luca's quest for "sincerity," as well as his "Chineseness," served,   
toward the end of his imprisonment, to bring him into a position   
  
lo6 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
of harmony with the officials: all became increasingly "frank" and   
"sincere." But it was sincerity at a price, and led him to the in-   
congruous position of "helping" a fellow-priest make a criminal   
"confession" — his furthest venture into "betrayal." He was, to be   
sure, still "hearing confessions'"; but now "sincerely" in harmony   
with the opposition.   
  
Yet this too was only partial and transient. Immediately upon   
release, he was identified by his religious colleagues once more as   
the dedicated Catholic priest, which he had never really ceased to   
be. He also faced the delicate problem of restoring his identity   
as a liberal confessor, deeply committed to an authoritarian Church.   
His identity flexibility required that he scrutinize the Communists,   

----------------------- Page 97-----------------------

the Church, and himself. In his profound sense of shame and   
guilt over having betrayed the Church (and himself), he felt the   
need to both relive and reformulate his relationship to it. Thus the   
story of the "naughty little girl" converted to active Catholicism   
despite parental opposition retells his own experience in enter-   
ing the priesthood. His "liberalism" had obliged him to give a hear-   
ing to some of the Communist message; but this involved him   
much less than his personal, credal, Catholic search. Now, as before,   
he could deal with his conflicts within his religious framework.   
  
He conveyed the feeling that his imprisonment had made him   
more open to others' influence, more submissive; these could be   
important changes, but as heightening of traits already present,   
rather than as new characteristics. Perhaps an even more profound   
upheaval for Father Luca was the need to surrender much of his   
"Chinese" self, leaving him in a state of mourning which began   
not with imprisonment, but after release. He gave me the feeling,   
however, that from his careful, painful, and conscience-ridden   
weighing of ideas and emotions, a somewhat remodeled, but still   
liberal (and not entirely un-Chinese) father-confessor was re-emerg-   
ing.   
  
Professor Hermann Castorp: The Submissive Scientist   
  
Let us now examine the experience of another man who falls   
into this general category of the obviously confused, yet responded   
quite differently from either Dr. Vincent or Father Luca. A biologist   
from Central Europe in his mid-fifties, Professor Castorp was intro-   
  
THE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSED 107   
  
duced to me by a member of his consulate in Hong Kong. Two or   
three of my other subjects who had met him in prison told me he   
had been "very progressive"; but when he came to see me just a   
few days after his release, he could best be described as "lost." In   
addition to the typical post-imprisonment fear and suspiciousness,   
he was overcome by loneliness, and sought group protection when-   
ever he could: "Even when crossing the street, I waited for a few   
people and crossed with the group." He welcomed the opportunity   
to talk things over with me, and so clearly enjoyed our three half-   
day sessions together that each time he was reluctant to leave. Yet   
despite his voluble answers to my questions, and his eagerness to   
prolong our talks, his manner was vague and distant, much like   
that of the stereotype of the "absent-minded professor."   
  
Both in his native Austria, and during his twenty-five years in   
China, Professor Castorp had lived the quiet and detached life of   
the scholar. A hard worker and a capable, well-liked teacher, he put   
a premium upon meeting— or even exceeding — the demands of   
others:   
  
I have always had the tendency to satisfy people. ... I have never   

----------------------- Page 98-----------------------

wanted to displease anyone. If I am given work, I try to do better than   
what is expected. ... If you give me a salary that is satisfactory, my   
entire energy is yours.   
  
He attributed these traits to his "strongly Catholic" and "very   
conservative" Teutonic upbringing; to his stern and "sober" govern-   
ment-official father who, although he remained in the background   
in most family matters, had opinions which counted ("What will   
he think of me if I do something wrong?"); and even more to his   
"dictatorial" mother ("The kind of person other people submit   
to — even dogs listen to her") who directed everyone in the house-   
hold, bought all of Hermann's socks and underwear until he was   
twenty-two years old, and created an atmosphere within the home   
which ensured "that things must be done in a way that mother is   
pleased."   
  
In his schooling he worked actively to please his teacher; and dur-   
ing the years afterward, he continued to seek to please others, and   
avoid contention.   
  
I didn't like to have the teacher angry at me. A driving force was to   
keep my teacher satisfied. This makes it happier for everyone, for him   
  
lo8 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
and for me. ... I always try to find out what in the other person I   
could agree with. ... I don't like people who conjure up big conflicts.   
  
Similarly, he accepted without question the Catholic religion in   
which he was brought up. He was concerned much less with its   
dogma than with the loyalties which he felt to its moral principles,   
and to the family and Church organization around it: "I am the   
kind of man who must live in some kind of organization or society   
where I feel the need to do good."   
  
He thrived on the "simple cultured form of life" of the Youth   
Movement in which he participated, especially by its "clean," Puri-   
tanical emphasis, and its single-mindedness: "I like people with   
strong convictions who stick to them."   
  
But the one area in which he found active self-expression and   
which became his true "holy of holies," was science:   
  
I am a scientist by conviction. I have been since very early in life. It is   
as an artist uses his art. I like to use my hands, my equipment, to ex-   
periment and to teach others.   
  
He even defied his parents in embarking on this career, as they   
had a different profession in mind for him; but at the same time,   
he believed his scientific interests to be an inheritance from his   
maternal grandfather. He also felt that in his work — in his passion   
for research, his abilities as a teacher, his originality in construct-   

----------------------- Page 99-----------------------

ing apparatus — he was, like his mother, a "leading spirit" whom   
others sought to follow.   
  
He avoided considerations of philosophy and metaphysics ("The   
more you think about them, the more confused you are"), and had   
no concern with politics or with abstract ideological principles   
of any kind; what mattered to him was the operation of a system:   
  
I am not interested in names — monarchy, democracy, dictatorship. I am   
interested in how things are actualized — how they work. I do feel there   
must be a factor of stability.   
  
Coming to China at the invitation of a missionary university, he   
found conditions very agreeable to him in both his personal and   
professional lives. He was devoted enough to his strong-minded wife;   
but he readily tolerated long separations brought about by European   
medical treatments which her ailments were said to require, as   
  
THE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSED 109   
  
long as another equally forceful woman could be found to run   
his household. Never too drawn to the sensual side of life, he was   
passionately involved in his teaching and his research. He thrived   
upon the difficult working conditions, and especially enjoyed the   
feeling that his professional skills were indispensable. Moreover,   
he delighted in the slow pace of Chinese life, and in what he   
called the "spirit of compromise" of the Chinese people. He found   
himself readily blending with his environment:   
  
It is very interesting how surroundings influence you. . . . The stu-   
dents had a certain way of eating. I began automatically to eat just like   
them. ... I even began to call a dog in the Chinese way.   
  
His evaluation of the political regimes under which he lived   
depended largely upon those around him. Thus he at first was im-   
pressed with the Nationalist Government "because I saw the en-   
thusiasm of the students"; later he shared with them a strong resent-   
ment of the Japanese invaders, but then he found "a few Japanese   
who were not bad people," explaining that "in everyone I can see   
something good." Mostly, however, he was disinterested in the   
world about him except as it pertained to his work. He did not care   
for psychological probing, but "if someone told me something   
about myself, I always thought, probably he is right — there must   
be something in it."   
  
He continued his work after the Communists came to power;   
but when the new regime took over the running of his university,   
he decided to leave because "I thought I would not fit." Several   
delays occurred in his getting an exit permit, followed by his unex-   
pected arrest.   
  
His response in prison from the beginning was to confess every-   

----------------------- Page 100-----------------------

thing he could about his own past actions, and avoid antagoniz-   
ing his captors. Compared to Father Luca and Dr. Vincent, the   
pressures applied to him were relatively mild: no chains, no hand-   
cuffs, and none of the persistently extreme accusation which leads   
to falsification. On his part, he made a consistent effort to adapt   
himself as well as he could to this difficult environment, rather   
than concern himself with moral or ideological issues. "It is hard   
to say how I felt. I cannot judge these things, although I can easily   
find a concrete course to take."   
  
His personal confession was not too greatly emphasized, and he   
  
HO THOUGHT REFORM   
  
was quickly exposed to re-education. To the hsiieh hsi sessions he   
brought the approach of a scientist:   
  
I paid close attention. I wanted to find what it was about. Mine was   
the attitude of research.   
  
His approach was made feasible by his captors' failure to make   
him, as they did most other Europeans, a special target. "They   
saw at once that I was harmless. If I talked a little, they didn't   
expect too much." Moreover, he was ingenious in his ingenuousness.   
  
From the very beginning I said what I thought and this made it easier   
for me. ... By nature I am anti-revolutionary. I don't like everything   
turned upside down. So when the Communists said, "You are anti-   
revolutionary," they were right and I admitted it. I said, "I am." If   
you admit things openly, they do not make so much fuss about it, they   
simply preach to you. But the moment you tell them stories, they get   
mad.   
  
But his "research" (he was, after all, a participant-observer) led   
him to accept as valid much of the "data."   
  
I began to understand many things that I did not understand before.   
... It was a logical system in itself — talking about land distribution,   
why the tenants were poor — about China's losses from the international   
imperialists — things I've never been interested in before. I saw for the   
first time how the Chinese themselves felt about these matters. My   
whole thinking about these problems was enlarged.   
  
Nor could he disentangle himself from the bias of his teachers' jar-   
gon, although he recognized it for what it was: "Old China was   
bad, new China good, and America bad — it is an official kind of   
language."   
  
He could even begin to accept the Communist point of view   
about his own criminal guilt, although it was based only upon   
anti-Communist statements he had previously made: "From the   
way I talked before, I influenced others against the Communists   

----------------------- Page 101-----------------------

— so from their point of view I am guilty." But he was never able to   
develop a strong inner sense of sinfulness, and his cellmates fre-   
quently criticized him because he had no "feeling of guilt." He   
thought that such a feeling was "too much to expect from a man,   
because the world is not a religious order, and their requirements   
  
THE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSED   
  
111   
  
were too high."   
  
He viewed Communism as a religion, a point he made frequently   
during our interviews, yet at the same time he managed to hold   
on to the general principles of his own Catholic faith. Here he once   
more made use of the scientist's approach.   
  
I would emphasize the scientific explanation of the world, saying that   
there must have been a beginning, and therefore religion has a place.   
They would say, "This is a scientific religion, and it is all right." Offi-   
cially, they were just supposed to be against superstition and not against   
religion.   
  
At the same time, his sense of involvement in the Catholic re-   
ligion was of profound importance in his holding on to his sense   
of identity.   
  
I would always figure out whether it was Easter or some other Catholic   
holy day so that I could stick to their custom. ... If I had no reli-   
gious background, it is possible that I would have committed suicide.   
  
He was pleased by the more favorable treatment accorded him   
as he became increasingly viewed as a "progressive"; but he was   
disturbed by the moves from one cell to another which this shift   
in status brought about. "I disliked changing groups. I felt I be-   
longed to a group like a chicken belongs to its flock." Moreover,   
after a period of time, he found his "research" less and less reward-   
ing:   
  
After I understood the fundamentals, I began to get bored by it all —   
then the main thing became avoiding trouble. . . . Ten hours a day   
is too much, you get overfed, and this kills off deeper interests.   
  
But he always retained the strong need to please his captors, as   
well as an underlying wish to be free of them — reflected in a re-   
current dream which he had during his imprisonment.   
  
I would dream I was allowed to go home for an afternoon. I didn't   
remember whether I was required to return at night or allowed to return   
the next day. I thought, "You are too stupid — you will do something   
wrong and the man will be very angry with you."   
  

----------------------- Page 102-----------------------

In his associations to this dream, he relates it to his lifelong pattern   
of avoiding conflict through submission.   
  
112 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
I didn't want to displease the official, I would always give in in order   
to avoid conflict. ... It was my duty to ask him when to come back   
and not to break the rule. ... I have a feeling that I am this kind   
of person — who does things wrong and who forgets — this could happen   
to me. ... I always must satisfy people.   
  
After his release, his "lost" appearance reflected both his emo-   
tional and ideological confusion. Sometimes, like Vincent, he   
seemed to be longing for the security he had known in prison.   
At other times he would criticize the unfair practices of the Com-   
munists, but then temper his criticism, using the thought reform   
language: "Of course the people know this." Of his former jailers   
he said: "Objectively speaking they are wrong. But you can't help   
but have a respect for these men. They work hard and sacrifice and   
have a certain human value."   
  
In a personal sense, he was very labile in his emotions. He formed   
quick attachments to people he met in Hong Kong, especially if   
they had also just been in a Chinese prison. He was quick to weep   
when one of these friends left the Colony; he also wept just listen-   
ing to sad music. But he expressed an optimistic note despite his   
difficulties, recognizing his need to "absorb and repair," comparing   
himself to a "business which has gone bankrupt and now has to   
start up again." He seemed on the whole less emotionally dis-   
turbed than either Dr. Vincent or Father Luca, and others among   
my subjects who knew him told me that they felt he had weathered   
the experience much better than they had.   
  
One of his ways of dealing with his own confusion was to at-   
tempt to look at thought reform from a distance, discuss its general   
principles, its effectiveness, and its economy of manpower. At the   
same time, he would try to evaluate how useful the experience had   
been to him; his conclusions were ambivalent, but helpful to him   
in working out his feelings.   
  
A few months would have been worth it — but not three years. ... I   
am not converted so much that I go one hundred percent to their way   
— but what 1 have seen and learned is worth something.   
  
He sought to maintain a fatalistic attitude toward his imprison-   
ment: "It can't be helped — like breaking a leg. ... It was a revolu-   
tion, and they had the guns and not I." And to remain critical of   
both worlds: "I can't say that it was justice, but I can't say that   
  
THE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSED 11 3   
  
there is justice here in Hong Kong either."   

----------------------- Page 103-----------------------

  
During the course of his stay in Hong Kong, however, he began   
to be more critical of Communists, questioning much of what   
they had taught him, and especially condemning their police   
methods.   
  
A person you know must tell all about you — they want to check every-   
thing. I dislike this police element of the state. I had the attitude of old   
China — that the best government is one that you don't see or feel at   
all. . . . There, from the time you get up in the morning until the   
time you go to bed at night, they control you.   
  
During our last talk together, his words were again conciliatory   
rather than critical. About his own experience he said:   
  
I don't like it; I have lost # too much. But when you go to a country   
like that, you must expect that these things can happen. . . . Who   
can I blame? The whole of China because it is so backward? The KMT   
[Nationalists] because it was so corrupt? The Communists because   
they could gain victory?   
  
And about Communism in general:   
  
Communism is good for the Chinese — for countries with primitive   
economic conditions — but I cannot imagine it for the West. . . . But   
if it makes the West more conscious of the need for social reform, then   
it has done some good.   
  
He began to make active efforts to rearrange his personal life, seek-   
ing a new teaching position in the Far East, again in association   
with a Catholic missionary group. He realized that his concerns   
about ideological questions would become much less important to   
him once he got back to work: "When I find another job, things   
will be fixed up — then I won't talk about these other things any   
more."   
  
The patterns of Professor Castorp's early life, imprisonment, and   
post-release period suggest the identity of the submissive scientist.   
He had been consistently submissive in his attempts to please   
parents, teachers, Western and Chinese associates, his wife, prison   
officials, friends in Hong Kong who had shared his experience,   
and, during our interviews, me. Beginning with his parents, he   
  
114 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
could feel sure of love and protection only insofar as he complied   
with other people's wishes; compliance meant being open to their   
influence. Consequently, he was deeply influenced by thought re-   
form, and he retained more of its ideology than had either Dr.   
Vincent or Father Luca.   
  
This is an apparent contradiction: a man most submissive and   

----------------------- Page 104-----------------------

open to influence seems to be in the end least emotionally affected   
by thought reform. The contradiction disappears, however, if we   
recognize that people like Professor Castorp have the ability to   
hold on to what is most important, while seeming to surrender   
so much of themselves. Once he had become a scientist — his solu-   
tion to the identity crisis of adolescence — this identity became the   
most precious and the most creative part of his being. Science had   
for him some of the mystical appeal which medicine had for Dr.   
Vincent and the priesthood for Father Luca, because it enabled him   
to channel his energies and find his individual form of self-realiza-   
tion. It was the one area in which he could show defiance (whether   
to parents, wife, or existing intellectual principles), become a leader   
of men, and find a passionate meaning in life.   
  
On the other hand, although being a scientist was the one thing   
that was specifically his, it also had deep connections with his   
early family identifications. He felt the scientist in him to be part   
of his maternal heritage, and he associated this powerful part of   
himself with his mother. Whatever their demands, his parents   
had transmitted to him a strong sense of commitment to family,   
religion, and nationality (the last more cultural than political).   
This sense of commitment contained the single-mindedness which   
he admired; and this single-mindedness — enhanced by a repressed   
sexuality — he brought to his own scientific work. Thus, when un-   
der fire, he could call upon both his Catholic religion and his scien-   
tific research attitude 2 for strength; it was not the dogma of either   
which mattered, but rather the sense of affirmation and the sur-   
vival techniques which both could supply.   
  
Professor Castorp was also fortunate in the high status accorded   
the scientist in the thought reform environment. Indeed, the iden-   
tity of the scientist was one which Communist theorists always   
claimed for themselves. Thus, as long as he submitted on questions   
of ideology (which had never had great importance to him), they   
permitted him to retain what he held most sacred. He could re-   
  
THE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSED 115   
  
main the empiricist, and keep his gaze on the system, rather than   
look deeply into himself. To be sure, he could hardly maintain   
complete scientific accuracy in dealing with thought reform material.   
Nobody could. But by keeping relatively intact that part of himself   
dedicated to precision and truth, he could at least maintain a check   
upon the most gross distortions, and bring into play immediately   
following his release an unusually effective reality-testing mechanism.   
  
The importance of the mild treatment which Professor Castorp   
received should not be overlooked. Less bludgeoned — physically   
and mentally — he did not experience guilt and shame as deeply as   
did both Dr. Vincent and Father Luca. Had his reformers been more   
severe, they might have tapped a good deal more guilt and shame   
in him, too: mild-mannered men like Professor Castorp are likely   

----------------------- Page 105-----------------------

to feel guilty about the hostilities which they tend to repress. His   
post-release identity crisis was that of a dependent man deprived   
of his props, a single-minded man deprived of his raison <T£tre,   
a creative and a plodding man deprived of his materials and of his   
routine. Although his emotional balance had been disturbed, and   
although he had experienced more of a sense of evil than he realized,   
his basic identity structure had not been overturned. His tendency   
was clearly to return to his scientific work and let the ideologies   
take care of themselves.   
  
General Patterns   
  
There were, then, many different responses among the obviously   
confused. Most of the prisoners fell in this category, and its elements   
of confusion and search were present in some degree in everyone   
who experienced thought reform. But the obviously confused West-   
erners were distinguished by the fact that their confusion and search   
were conscious, and therefore openly dealt with, while the reactions   
of the apparent converts and the apparent resisters were more rigid   
and hidden. Yet even in this group, much of the reform experience   
— as well as the older emotions which it revived — had to be quickly   
repressed.   
  
When I saw most of these people, they had set themselves the   
task of returning to what was essentially their previous identity   
while trying to come to grips with, rather than totally accept or   
totally reject, the influences they had just experienced. One expres-   
  
Il6 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
sion of this task was the conviction of most of them that certain   
reforms were necessary and desirable in the non-Communist world,   
if only to meet the Communist challenge. As Professor Castorp   
put it:   
  
If there is rivalry between the Communists and the West for social   
reform, that is very good. ... Maybe Communism's mission is, by its   
push and impact, to give special strength to social reform. I have the   
impression that the West should do this. If Western Germany raises   
the living standard, East Germany will die a natural death.   
  
And a businessman, although committed to private enterprise,   
expressed similar sentiments:   
  
I am in favor of a gradual evolution of social reform rather than Com-   
munist revolution. . . . But some means must come about in which   
the rich will be less rich and the poor less poor. ... It may take hun-   
dreds of years.   
  
These men had to express such broad convictions to buttress their   
personal reintegration into the Western world, to give some mean-   
ing to their escape from the thought reform influence. Having been   

----------------------- Page 106-----------------------

made painfully aware of the West's (in many cases all too real)   
shortcomings, each required a sense of alternative to Communism   
which would include correction of some of these shortcomings.   
The stress they put upon economic reform may have been in part   
a use of the prison idiom; but their even greater stress upon the   
need to maintain personal freedom while accomplishing these   
reforms was certainly a rejection of the ideas of thought reform and   
an affirmation of their Western heritage. (It is perhaps unneces-   
sary to add that my emphasis of underlying psychological factors is   
not meant to imply that such attitudes toward the West are in-   
appropriate. 3 )   
  
For all of these reasons, the obviously confused Westerners tended   
to suffer post-release identity crises which were visibly severe —   
partly because they had been emotionally stranded between the   
two worlds, and partly because they had brought to the surface   
emotions which in others remain buried.   
  
CHAPTER   
  
VARIETIES OF RESPONSE:   
  
APPARENT CONVERTS   
  
Apparent converts were those who made newspaper   
headlines, who emerged from prison in a state loudly   
proclaimed as "brainwashed." However one may deplore jour-   
nalistic sensationalism, there is no doubt that these people did   
undergo a startling personal change in their view of the world. To   
talk with one of them immediately after his arrival in Hong Kong   
was, to say the least, an impressive experience. They seemed to   
speak only in cliches, parroting the Communist stock phrases, and   
defending the Communist position at every point.   
  
During my stay in Hong Kong, three such people appeared. One   
of them was a Jesuit priest, who will be discussed in Chapter 11;   
for reasons involving both his colleagues and himself, I was not   
able to meet him then. The other two were introduced to me,   
but the suspicious and defensive emotions engendered by their   
reform made them wary of talking with a psychiatrist, especially   
an American psychiatrist, and both refused to discuss their ex-   
periences with me. From my brief encounters with them, how-   
ever, and from what others — journalists and old friends from China    
living in Hong Kong — told me about them, I was able to obtain   
certain impressions about their behavior.   
  
One of them repeated his stock phrases in an agitated manner,   
  
"7   
  
Il8 THOUGHT REFORM   
  

----------------------- Page 107-----------------------

proclaiming his "shame and remorse for the harm I have done to   
the Chinese people," and praising the "real democracy of China"   
and the "free discussion" within the prison. But his extreme tension,   
as well as his need to protest too much — to repeat the cliches even   
when not asked — made me feel that he had serious, if unconscious,   
doubts about his position, and that the structure of his new identity   
was brittle. This judgment was borne out later on.   
  
The other, a young woman, was quite different, and much more   
convincing. Rather than nervousness, she exhibited the euphoric   
calm of a religious convert. In quiet tones she told a friend that   
should her family and other people in America reject her and fail   
to understand her views, it would then be necessary for her to   
take her life, because "this would at least tell the people of the   
world about my being persecuted and reveal the truth to them."   
(One might speculate that her use of the word "persecuted" was   
an unconscious reference to her prison experience, but there was   
no doubt that she was at the time giving expression to an urge to   
martyrdom, and referring to the hostility which she anticipated   
— and sought — from the people at home.)   
  
After meeting these two people, I wondered what psychological   
mechanisms were responsible for their being so much more affected   
by the reform process than anyone else I had seen. I learned more   
about the problem later, not from them, but from two others I   
interviewed after their return to the West: the Jesuit just men-   
tioned, whom I met three-and-a-half years after his release (my con-   
tact with him was thus both a first evaluation and a follow-up study) ;   
and another young woman I interviewed in Canada three months   
after her release, whose case is described below.   
  
Jane Darrow: The Missionary's Daughter   
  
A young Canadian teacher had emerged from more than four   
years of imprisonment with strong praise for her captors. She told   
reporters that the Communists had been justified in arresting her,   
that she had "passed information" to Western diplomats, and that   
she had confessed these crimes fully during her imprisonment. She   
admitted (rather reluctantly) that she had been in chains; but she   
said that her failure to confess the truth justified it. She spoke of   
the prison as a "place of hope" where "new people are made," at   
  
APPARENT CONVERTS 119   
  
the same time denouncing the "war-mongering" and "genu warfare"   
of the Americans. A diplomat expressed the sentiments of most   
Westerners who met her when he described Miss Darrow as "badly   
brainwashed."   
  
Even back in Canada, three months later, Miss Darrow had reser-   
vations about talking with me, and our meeting was arranged only   
through the efforts of mutual friends. She was a rather attractive   

----------------------- Page 108-----------------------

young woman in her midthirties, alert, tense, and unusually articu-   
late. She was immediately friendly, but at the same time suspicious,   
and inquired in some detail about who I was and what my purpose   
was in talking with her. She was also, however, eager to plunge into   
her story. This was the first time she had told it from beginning   
to end, and she obviously derived much emotional benefit both   
from the telling itself, and from the opportunity to discuss her com-   
plicated feelings with another person who knew something about   
her experience. During the ten hours we spent together, she re-   
mained enthusiastically absorbed in her detailed description.   
  
She quickly expressed the opinion that her "Chinese" background   
had a great deal to do with her response. Born in China of Cana-   
dian Protestant missionary parents, she had spent more than half   
of her life there. She looked back very critically on her childhood   
attitudes toward the Chinese people: "I don't think I had any real   
feeling for them per se. . . . I liked living in China because life   
was comfortable"; and she emphasized the "satisfying sense of su-   
periority," and the "gunboat psychology" which she, as a Westerner   
in China, had known. Yet this attitude was far from the whole   
story, since a little later she told me of her deep affection for these   
same Chinese people: "I loved them tremendously." When she was   
sent to Canada for her secondary school and university education,   
however, she avoided mentioning her Chinese past, and tried to   
"hide from my background" in order to find "identity [the word   
was hers] with the group there." But whether the foreigner in   
China or the "Chinese" girl in Canada, she felt she was different   
from those around her, and when later she returned to China as   
a teacher, and a student of Chinese culture, she began to be un-   
comfortably aware of her "lack of roots."   
  
She spoke of "serious tensions" in her family life; she usually   
found herself allied with her strong-willed and opinionated mother   
in a mutual impatience with her well-meaning, but ineffectual   
  
120 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
father. She had, early in life, rebelled against austere and dogmatic   
Protestant religious teachings. She always had difficulty coming to   
terms with the "iron-clad honesty" which her parents demanded,   
believing herself to fall far short of this ideal: "I bordered on cheat-   
ing and was not above the use of a lie." Her legacy of susceptibility   
to guilt was, as one might expect, a strong and painful one; "I have   
always been very quick to feel guilty." This reached the point where   
she let letters from her parents lie unopened for several months,   
because "every letter was a stab . . . and I did not want to read   
the reprimands."   
  
Always bright and much interested in the world about her, Jane   
became deeply concerned with social reform in both China and   
the West. She felt that missionary influences, as well as lifelong   
financial difficulties, affected her militant liberalism.   

----------------------- Page 109-----------------------

  
With my missionary background, I've always felt that something should   
be done to better the world. . . . My lack of economic security has   
been a driving force in my life. ... I thought that society was man-   
made, and should be regulated in the interests of man.   
  
When she returned to China as a teacher after the war, she was   
highly critical of the Nationalist regime, but at the same time had   
"an anti-Communist orientation." She shared these views with   
Western and Chinese friends, and was in fact more comfortable   
in such intellectual and ideological matters than in purely social   
situations. She felt that a tendency to be too outspoken and critical   
had interfered with many friendships. In her relationships with men,   
in particular, she believed her forceful intellect to be a disadvantage,   
and sometimes wished she were "more of a powderpuff." Always   
restrained in sexual matters, she was long aware of both discom-   
fort and unfulfilled longing in her response to masculine overtures.   
  
During the period preceding her imprisonment she found her-   
self — along with a few other Westerners — leading a beleaguered   
existence. Increasingly cut off from Chinese friends, she was aware   
her movements were being observed, and she was not completely   
surprised when her arrest finally occurred.   
  
Miss Darrow's prison treatment was virtually identical with that   
described for men. At the beginning she was subjected to the   
physical and emotional pressures of prolonged interrogations, in-   
cessant "struggles," chains and handcuffs, and enforced standing   
  
APPARENT CONVERTS 121   
  
for as long as thirty-six hours. She resisted for a while, and made   
up a false story which was not accepted; but within a few days   
she had produced an "espionage" confession which was a dis-   
torted reinterpretation of her actual behavior. She did not at the   
time inwardly accept its validity, but did feel extremely troubled   
("I hated myself!") for having so quickly made this confession   
and for having supplied detailed information about Chinese ac-   
quaintances.   
  
This sense of shame and guilt was heightened by her experiences   
among other women in her cell. A well-educated, Westernized   
Chinese girl, with whom she closely identified herself, came to the   
cell apparently fully convinced of the Communist position, and   
critical of Miss Darrow for her "backwardness." Cell relationships   
were highly charged and highly personal; she referred repeatedly   
to a hated cell chief as "the bitch" and another person as "the   
fiery woman."   
  
During these early stages, she felt a number of conflicting emo-   
tions: initial resentment; embarrassment at being a prisoner and   
at being in such a low-level all-Chinese environment; guilt ("I had   

----------------------- Page 110-----------------------

curious regrets at not having written the family"); a "grim curi-   
osity"; a sense of opportunity ("I thought it might be grist for my   
mill and that I would write a book about it"); and perhaps most   
important, a sense of surrendering herself to the inevitable ("You   
have the feeling that you are being pushed through something you   
can't control. ... it breeds a sort of lightheadedness").   
  
But at the same time, she applied herself to the study of the   
"rhythms" of her environment, and soon concluded that "every-   
thing I believed about the world was not acceptable." Then, during   
a self-examination, she was surprised at the extremely enthusiastic   
acceptance of her statement that she had been leading a "parasitic   
life." Thus encouraged, she continued to express this kind of highly   
critical judgment on her entire past — an approach which she found   
came quite naturally to "a guilt-ridden person like myself." In   
this and in her general views, she "tried to put on a convincing act   
of being progressive. . . . and a good show of being honest." But   
this "act" became extremely uncomfortable for her, not only be-   
cause her "veneer" and "lack of sincerity" were criticized by the   
others, but primarily because she herself found it difficult to   
tolerate her own "dishonesty."   
  
122 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
I was a cracked bowl. I didn't ring true. ... I was inferior to people   
who really tried to reform . . . they really felt guilty. I was superficial.   
. . . And I respond to the ideal of being good.   
  
As she felt worse and worse about the "double game" which she   
was playing (or thought she was playing), she began to look upon   
herself in general with ever-increasing contempt:   
  
I realized that my professed feeling for liberals was not very deep. I   
was a scheming, small person . . . with a basically opportunistic phi-   
losophy. . . . When I reached the bottom, there was nothing more.   
  
She began to not only say, but really feel, that she had been,   
and was then, evil: in her attitude of "superiority" toward Chinese,   
and in her "recognition" that she had (despite economic difficul-   
ties) really been a member of the "upper class," and had unfairly   
enjoyed all of its advantages. More and more her "tactic" — "I was   
always trying to establish the fact that I was sincere" — became her   
reality.   
  
Her change was furthered by much that she saw and "learned":   
the "proof" of American use of germ warfare — especially when this   
was "confirmed" by the report of a missionary whom she felt must   
be reliable, because "I know my father would not tell a lie"; the   
United Nations "procrastinations" in the truce negotiations of the   
Korean War; and the progress of the "completely planned" Chinese   
society ("social and economic accomplishments and getting things   
done that other governments had promised but never delivered.")   

----------------------- Page 111-----------------------

She was especially struck by the realization that what was happen-   
ing to her was related to the broad Chinese scene: "I had viewed   
thought reform as a punishment — restricted to prisoners — but here   
was the reform of all society." All of this made her feel more com-   
fortable, as "it gave me the intellectual basis for some things I had   
already accepted on an emotional basis."   
  
Yet over the years of her reform, and despite her continuing   
"progress," she could not get herself to believe fully in her con-   
fessed "espionage" activities. "I never accepted this as me." She   
found it always necessary to make a distinction between her "per-   
sonal predicament" and "the broad social facts." While conscious   
that "there was a discrepancy," she sought to get around it by giv-   
ing less importance to her own situation: "I did more thinking   
  
APPARENT CONVERTS 123   
  
about society than about myself. ... I worked from outward-in-   
ward rather than inward-outward." Using this device, she could   
begin to accept "the general logic of their position" in viewing her   
"passing of information" to people who could use it in a way   
harmful to the Communist regime as "espionage."   
  
As with other prisoners, her relations with the government dur-   
ing the last month of her imprisonment were characterized by   
mutual frankness and co-operation. Miss Darrow found herself   
able to admit that she could not completely view herself as a spy,   
and after so doing was praised for her honesty. Transferred to a   
new cell where her "dark past" was unknown, she had what she   
considered to be a new opportunity to "make good." She was even   
briefly appointed as cell chief, in her view a mixed blessing: "I   
didn't want it because I was afraid of muffing it, but I was flattered   
because I had come up from the bottom." She retained the job   
long enough to "help" a new prisoner (one with a background of   
missionary education) to her confession; but because she found   
herself "feeling guilty" in carrying out the duties of the cell chief,   
she was unable to be decisive with other prisoners and was finally,   
at her own request, replaced.   
  
At this time, she was also impressed by the dedication of many of   
the prison officials (both male and female), by their willingness to   
extend themselves to solve all problems, their readiness to admit   
past mistakes, and their "growth as human beings" — which she   
felt she could recognize over the course of her imprisonment. She   
was especially influenced by one male prisoner-official assigned to   
her case, a highly cultivated Westernized Chinese with whom she   
felt much in common — and who reminded her of a man she had   
once been fond of.   
  
She was struck by the kindness and patience with which young   
prisoners were treated after the general improvement in prison   
conditions, and by the consideration for children, some of whom   

----------------------- Page 112-----------------------

lived for periods of time with their mothers in the cells. She was   
grateful for special rations of hot water for the women to wash   
their hair, and for the issue of new uniforms; she noted the officials'   
concern with the prisoners' diet and medical care and felt that   
there was a great effort made to "permit us a sense of dignity."   
Finally, Miss Darrow rounded out her re-education through ex-   
tensive reading of Marxist texts, some of which she had asked for   
  
124 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
as her interest developed.   
  
Shortly before her release, she struggled with the problem of   
whether or not she wished to remain in China. She considered stay-   
ing (or trying to stay) both because of her admiration for the   
new regime and her love for China:   
  
Lots of things made me generally in admiration of this society. I felt   
very warmly toward it and couldn't bear the thought that I would   
always be cut off from it. . . . It seemed right, the way of the future.   
. . . And after all, I had lived there most of my life, and I adored   
Peking.   
  
She also felt closer to the Chinese people than ever before: "I   
had found the real person." And she believed that, should she re-   
main, the years spent in prison "would count" and she would be   
appreciated ( "in that society you don't have to be apologetic about   
having ideas") — while at the same time she felt certain that she   
would be "out of step" back in the West.   
  
On the other hand, she also thought frequently of her parents   
and of an older woman who had been like a parent to her. "If my   
mother and father were dead I would not have come home — but   
when I thought of the three of them, I decided I would return."   
She also remembered things like Christmas in Canada, and in the   
end it was the West and family ties which prevailed.   
  
At the time of her trial, she could not rid her mind of the   
feeling that it was all "rigged," and felt greatly embarrassed at be-   
ing seen as a "spy" by the Chinese spectators, because "I didn't want   
them to feel this about me." She was "amazed" at the "light"   
sentence (expulsion rather than additional time in prison), and at   
the same time was concerned about the problems of the future.   
In a last "moving" discussion with her judge, the difficulties of   
returning were frankly discussed; the judge expressed the hope that   
she would retain a "realization of what the world was about,"   
and pointed to the example set by a friend of hers, another West-   
erner who had taken a strong "stand" in favor of his re-education   
after his release. Prison officials had kept them informed about   
each other, and this information about his "stand" impressed Miss   
Darrow very greatly.

It made me feel that I could be as good as he. We felt it together — he   
put across his case — I could too.

Upon her arrival in Hong Kong, she was aware of the ordeal   
she had been put through; but her allegiance to her captors was   
so great that she was determined to present only their position,   
and to suppress any material which would undermine it. Her at-   
titude was reinforced by a letter she was handed when she crossed   
the border, written by the friend who had been previously released,   
offering advice and encouragement. Her anticipation of difficulty   
with the press only increased her resolve.   
  
I didn't want to say anything to a hostile press against a group getting   
such a fine deal for a large section of humanity. ... I had made up   
my mind I would not mention the chaining. . . . This showed my   
identification with the Communists. ... I asked myself how much   
they would want me to say.   
  
The more her words were questioned, the more she defended her   
captors ("I was like a fighting lion"); but the entire experience was   
deeply disturbing to her ("It was hell!").   
  
Feeling uncomfortable with consular officials who met her, she   
elected to stay with old missionary associates of her family in Hong   
Kong, a decision she had thought about before her release. There   
she was made comfortable, was not challenged, and felt "reassured."   
In thinking about her situation in this more relaxed setting, she   
began to feel that what she had said at the press conference might   
not have been completely accurate, and she determined "to put   
the facts on the table with no distortions." But she did nothing   
to carry out this resolve, and when some of the missionaries asked   
her how she had been treated, her answer was, "Perfectly well."   
Moreover, she even felt guilty for considering such a change of   
policy, viewing it again through the eyes of the prison officials:   
"I felt that this was my first retreat — the first thing I would have   
to explain to them ... if I were to go back."   
  
When she arrived home and faced the conflicted emotions of her   
family relationships, she was unable to discuss her imprisonment   
with her parents; but she did talk about it at great length with   
two friends. These discussions were sometimes very helpful to her,   
and at other times confusing, since her feelings about her reform   
varied greatly and depended largely on which friend she was talk-   
ing to.   
  
Her closest friend — the older woman whom she recognized as   
  
126 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
a substitute for her mother — exerted the greater influence; she lived   

----------------------- Page 114-----------------------

in the same city, and spent many hours listening sympathetically   
to Miss Darrow's story. She was never judging or critical; but as an   
anti-Communist liberal close to Miss Darrow's former position,   
she would occasionally gently point out some of the Communist   
inconsistencies and abuses. This relationship was of immense im-   
portance to Miss Darrow, and her friend's words had great impact   
on her. However, her more infrequent visits with the other friend   
— the man who had emerged from a Communist prison with an   
even more completely reformed attitude and a more rigid ad-   
herence to the Communist position — left her disturbed: "I felt   
guilty because I thought that maybe he was better than I was." At   
the same time, she shared many opinions with him about their   
experiences.   
  
She began to read a great deal, saw many liberal friends whose   
sympathy affected her, and became increasingly willing to question   
her experience: "Certain doubts have been allowed to arise." In   
her personal relations, always difficult for her in the past, she felt   
"easier, more in control of myself"; she retained certain fears and   
taboos in her relationships with men, but fewer than before, and   
she looked toward marriage in her quest for "emotional security."   
She returned to secondary school teaching, and at the same time   
maintained her strong interest in China.   
  
She remained greatly troubled and preoccupied with her personal   
sense of guilt. She felt guilty toward Communist prison officials   
and toward their entire society whenever she expressed (or even   
felt) anything critical about them; toward her own government be-   
cause she still held views in some ways favorable to Communism,   
although this guilt was mixed with feelings of gratitude toward   
Canadian officials for negotiating her release; and toward her   
parents because of her inability to be more warm to them. As she   
summed it up: "I am full of guilt complexes. ... I feel guilty   
almost about the rain."   
  
Near the end of our talks, she asked me questions about guilt   
feelings, and began to recognize the important part these had   
played in her own imprisonment: "Your attitude is a creature of   
your own guilt." But she continued to speak contemptuously of   
herself as she described her inner struggle between "the urge to   
adapt" (to her own culture) and "the compulsion to hold on" (to   
  
APPARENT CONVERTS 12J   
  
the Communist views), ever ready to denounce her own "selfish-   
ness" and "opportunism." As far as her political beliefs were con-   
cerned, she predicted to me that she would revert to being a "left-   
wing liberal," at the same time expressing the opinion that intel-   
lectual seeking had its limitations in finding the truth, and that one   
had to combine it with an "intuitive" approach as well.   
  
Miss Darrow, unlike those people in the obviously confused   

----------------------- Page 115-----------------------

category, continued, after she had crossed the border into Hong   
Kong, to present herself to the world as a reformed person. Dr.   
Vincent, Professor Castorp, and a large number of other subjects   
had so presented themselves to their captors; but for them the   
change from the Communist to the non-Communist world was a   
signal for the portions of themselves which had remained apart   
from thought reform influence to reappear. In Miss Darrow's case, it   
was as if nothing but her thought reform identity survived the ex-   
perience — and herein lay her "conversion." But the "as if" is im-   
portant; the contending elements were very much there, even if   
temporarily stilled, and this is why I refer to her conversion as "ap-   
parent."   
  
Still, we must ask ourselves, why did Miss Darrow experience   
such a conversion, even an incomplete one? What strikes us im-   
mediately is the Communists' manipulation of her conflicts over   
honesty and goodness, and over incomplete "Chineseness." These   
are once again problems of identity and guilt; and Miss Darrow's   
background encompasses many such problems in relationship to   
religion, ideology, and cultural conflict, and to historical, racial, and   
personal sensitivities.   
  
Miss Darrow's early and tenacious identity of the missionary's   
daughter included a near-absolute approach to good and evil, to   
guilt and sin. Her parents, and especially her mother, as individual   
carriers of the Protestant tradition sought to make their daughter   
"iron-clad," a bastion of honesty and goodness impregnable to the   
dishonesty and evil ever threatening from both without and within   
herself.   
  
In her rebellion against her origin, Miss Darrow struggled to   
find a more moderate course — a compromise identity which would   
neither violate the "ideal of being good" of her missionary back-   
ground nor perpetuate the narrowness which she came to see in it.   
  
128 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
In becoming the militant liberal (both in her character and her   
policies), she achieved a compromise which enabled her to swim   
with some of the most respected ideological currents around her.   
This, her most positive identity, embodied her accomplishments as   
an energetic but open-minded reformer, a member of a China-bom   
intellectual and cultural elite, and an experienced cosmopolite con-   
versant with both East and West.   
  
But from the beginning, her struggle was accompanied by many   
disruptive forces which shaped a negative identity of unusually large   
dimensions. On both a personal and an ideological level, her   
parents' inordinate stress upon "iron-clad honesty" produced in   
Miss Darrow — as it inevitably does — an attraction to honesty's   
opposite, to beating the game through the hidden maneuver, or   
the "use of the lie." This attraction had limited importance as a   

----------------------- Page 116-----------------------

mode of action, for Miss Darrow could bring to bear upon it the   
powerful conscience of the missionary's daughter: but for this at-   
traction she was forced to pay a terrible price in guilt. At the same   
time, the tyrannical judgments of her conscience ("negative con-   
science," as Erikson has called it) 1 could at any moment so magnify   
this pattern of guilt and self-condemnation that she would see her-   
self as nothing but a "selfish person," a "cheat" and a "liar."   
  
These personal sensitivities were fed by her historical situation,   
about which she was also guilt-prone: a privileged Westerner, who   
owed her position to imperialistic policies of questionable moral   
standing, living among poverty-stricken Chinese peasants and ar-   
ticulately resentful Chinese intellectuals. Closely related to this   
historical guilt was her racial guilt, a sense of evil which the more   
egalitarian representatives of any dominant race experience in   
relationship to any ambivalent feelings they may hold toward   
members of the dominated race. The stronger one's libertarian con-   
science, the greater the guilt. Miss Darrow could believe herself   
evil and insincere because she perceived her own sense of repulsion   
(itself partly a product of guilt) at the idea of becoming a Chinese   
and having to share personally the disadvantages of an oppressed   
race. The problem is insoluble as long as situations of racial dis-   
crimination or dominance persist, since guilt begets resentment,   
which in turn begets guilt; both emotions then cause suffering, as   
they did in Miss Darrow, in direct proportion to the amount of   
love felt for certain members (if not for the more abstract whole)   
  
APPARENT CONVERTS 129   
  
of the dominated race. And everything is magnified when the   
problem occurs in the oppressed race's native environment.   
  
Miss Darrow's identification with China had still deeper identity   
dimensions as well. Part of her did want to become entirely   
Chinese, to achieve complete union with the country of her birth —   
just as another part of her wished to be complete ly Western. She   
was a cultural outsider, belonging entirely to neither world, feeling   
guilty about both. She was part of the Chinese landscape, sur-   
rounded by Chinese people, and yet separated by special schools   
and special status, and ultimately by her face and the color of her   
skin. She faced similar problems as a Westerner: biologically she   
belonged, but she was separated by the most profound differences   
of background experience. Her identity as the China-born West-   
erner was a compromise; but in any crisis, the feeling of being a   
cultural outsider could reappear and further feed her negative   
identity.   
  
In the face of this broad negative spectrum, it is not surprising   
that the usual problems of guilt about parents and biological   
identity were intensified. Unable to open letters from home be-   
cause of the guilt they stimulated, Miss Darrow found herself pre-   
occupied with her "badness" as a daughter. Burdened at so many   

----------------------- Page 117-----------------------

levels, she felt conflict about her identity as a woman. The "bad   
daughter" and the "inadequate woman" thus joined the array of   
her negative identities formed from a combination of early sus-   
ceptibilities to guilt, later difficulties in the control of anger, and —   
perhaps most important of all — a fear of and desire for total sub-   
mission.   
  
For an element of totalism 2 — a tendency toward all-or-nothing   
emotional alignments — seems ever-present in Miss Darrow, working   
against the more moderate aspirations of her liberalism. It began   
with the ethos of absolute honesty and goodness bequeathed to   
her by her parents. It again appeared in her efforts to solve her   
adolescent identity crisis by becoming, at the expense of her com-   
plex cultural background, totally the Canadian girl. And at the   
onset of thought reform, the girl who had placed great emphasis   
upon controlling so much of her own behavior experienced a not   
entirely unpleasant "light headedness" at the moment of giving   
herself up to a force assuming complete power over her. To be sure,   
she fought against this tendency during the thought reform strug-   
  
130 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
gle; but hers was the type of vulnerability which can lead to the   
total plunge of the convert.   
  
And this is what happened — or almost happened. Thought re-   
form exploited each of these aspects of her negative identity, made   
conscious what was previously latent, and built into grotesque   
dimensions what had previously been held in balance. The core of   
her negative identity, the self-image of the "schemer," was a   
crucial factor in depriving her of a more moderate response to   
thought reform. Most of my subjects could think themselves   
reasonably clever and ingenious in playing the double game of   
acting "progressive" while retaining old beliefs, but Miss Darrow   
could only castigate herself for being a "cracked bowl." She could   
not permit herself the usual form of adaptation without experi-   
encing the most derogatory view of herself, since in so adapting an   
inner voice would accuse her of being "the schemer" which in early   
life she had been warned against becoming.   
  
Thus deprived of the usual defense against thought reform, she   
was at the mercy of her own totalism. As a response to her historical   
and racial guilt feelings, she saw herself as having lived not only a   
"parasitic" life, but a totally parasitic one. Similarly, she came to   
think herself totally removed from and unconcerned about the   
Chinese people, rather than maintaining (as did Father Luca, for   
instance) a more moderate view of a complex situation. On all of   
these issues, the reformers' totalism made contact with her own, as   
well as with the other features of her negative identity.   
  
Once the affirmative elements within her liberal identity had   
been undermined, she could be made to feel at one with the Com-   

----------------------- Page 118-----------------------

munist — and, more importantly, with the Chinese — world. For a   
person so long and so painfully the cultural outsider, this sense of   
belonging had a good deal to do with the outcome of thought re-   
form.   
  
When she was ready for rebirth, she was able to see in Com-   
munism many of her own liberal aspirations: dedicated people   
working "to better the world," regulating society "in the interests   
of man." She felt she was among gentlemanly and humane people,   
to whom submission would be justified. Their society appeared to   
offer fewer challenges to her problems of femininity, and more op-   
portunity for her old intellectual and newly-acquired ideological   
prowess. She emerged more a communist liberal than a true con-   
  
APPARENT CONVERTS 1J1   
  
vert.   
  
The element of totalism in her new identification with the   
Chinese Communists made her misrepresent her own inner feel-   
ings, and present only her reformed side. Still afraid of the negative   
identity of the "schemer," she viewed any criticism of the Com-   
munists or any reconciliation with her own society as selfishness   
and betrayal. These emotions were intensified by the reformed   
sentiments of her friend, since she was able to share with him one   
of the few identities left open to her, that of the reformed West-   
erner. But like everyone else, Miss Darrow felt the pull of old ties   
and old identities; in Hong Kong she turned to the missionaries for   
comfort and for an ideological moratorium. Once back in Canada,   
she felt the old appeal of her liberal identity, an appeal reinforced   
by those liberal friends who offered emotional security. Her liberal   
identity turned out to have been much stronger than one might   
have suspected: within it, the search for truth and careful reality-   
testing were both possible and necessary. At the time I spoke with   
Miss Darrow, the emotions of her negative self-image were still   
supplying fuel for her identity crisis. She gave me the feeling none-   
theless that whatever her eventual beliefs, she was emerging from   
totalism, and reaffirming the more moderate parts of herself.   
  
"Conversion" Trends   
  
In all cases of apparent conversion (the two I studied in detail,   
the two I met briefly, and two others I heard of) similar emotional   
factors seemed to be at play: a strong and readily accessible negative   
identity fed by an unusually great susceptibility to guilt, a tendency   
toward identity confusion (especially that of the cultural outsider),   
a profound involvement in- a situation productive of historical and   
racial guilt, and finally, a sizable element of totalism.   
  
It should be stressed, however, that I dealt with a very special   
group of subjects: any Westerner living in China over many years   
is likely to have experienced some form of profound identity search,   

----------------------- Page 119-----------------------

and many had missionary ties which enhanced their susceptibility   
to guilt. This deep involvement with China makes the conversion   
as much cultural as political.   
  
In Miss Darrow's case, her apparent conversion was associated   
with the identity struggles of the liberal. But an apparent con-   
  
132 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
version can also occur in a more authoritarian person. Guilt, identity   
conflict, and especially totalism are the important psychological   
factors, and these are not confined to any one kind of character   
structure.   
  
It is also important to keep in mind that individual traits, al-   
though immensely important, are just one side of the coin; the   
circumstances of imprisonment are the other. These were essentially   
similar in all cases; but the length of time which people were held   
and the intensity with which the Communists pursued their reform   
measures varied. Since vulnerabilities to conversion are to some   
extent present in everyone (no one is free from susceptibility to   
guilt, confusion over identity, and some degree of totalism), the   
variations in the circumstances of imprisonment have a special   
significance.   
  
There is a good deal of evidence — and European subjects fre-   
quently expressed this opinion to me — that American prisoners   
have been subjected to more severe pressures because of the inter-   
national political situation. There is no doubt that they have been   
held longer than other Westerners. If there is a slightly higher per-   
centage of apparent converts among American prisoners than   
among Europeans (this was not true for my subjects, but there   
have been some well-publicized cases of Americans who did fall   
into this group), these particularly difficult circumstances may   
have played an important part. Released Americans, when they re-   
turn home, also face very great pressure to abandon their reform   
identities — although this pressure has acted on some as an incen-   
tive to hold on to their reform.   
  
In any case, underneath any apparent conversion there is likely   
to be (as there was with Miss Darrow) an identity search no less   
profound, if not nearly as overt, as occurs among the obviously   
confused. The search is all the more difficult because so much of it   
must be hidden — from other people, and, to some extent, from   
the prisoner himself. Yet hidden doubts are very likely, after a   
period of time, to come to the surface, as they did with Miss Dar-   
row; and at this point, the apparent convert comes close to joining   
the ranks of the obviously confused. In becoming apparent con-   
verts in the first place, however, these people experience the most   
profound personal upheavals of any of the three groups.

VARIETIES OF RESPONSE:   
  
APPARENT RESISTERS   
  
Apparent resisters are the people who cross the   
border denouncing the cruelties of prison thought   
reform. At first encounter, many of them appear to be little affected   
by their ordeal, other than showing a certain amount of physical   
and mental strain; ideologically, they are bitterly anti-Communist,   
if anything, more so than they had been before imprisonment. They   
are received by the Western world with both admiration and relief   
— admiration for their strength, and relief for the proof which   
they convey that "brainwashing" can be resisted after all.   
  
In talking with them, I too was impressed with their courage   
and endurance. As I probed more deeply, however, I found that   
their inner resistance was not nearly so complete as their external   
expression suggested. Eight of the people I interviewed fell into   
this category. The following case best illustrates the diverse psycho-   
logical factors which influence resistance, the complicated mean-   
ings behind the later condemnation of the Communists, and the   
way in which reform influences come to the surface at unexpected   
moments.

134 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
Hans Barker: Priest, Doctor, Soldier   
  
One of the first subjects I interviewed was an elderly, goateed   
Belgian Bishop, a man who had lived in the interior of China for   
more than forty years prior to his three years of imprisonment.   
When I first saw him, he had already been in Hong Kong for three   
months, but he was still deeply preoccupied with his three-year   
reform experience. He immediately launched into his own analysis   
of the Communist approach, describing it in fundamentalist Cath-   
olic theological language. The evil and the power of the Communist   
behavior could only be explained, he felt, through the influence of   
demons — the evil counterpart of angels who have equally great   
power. His explanation, enthusiastically rendered, combined Bib-   
lical and modern history:   
  
The Old Testament says that the demons are the murderers of mankind.   
The Communists have killed off fantastic numbers of people. The de-   
mons seek to further the idea of people without God, as do the Com-   
munists. Both try to make the human being happy without God and   
against God. The demons are the mortal enemies of mankind. The   
demons make use of the Communists in order to kill as many human   
beings as is possible. . . . Therefore, in the long run, it is a religious   
question, only thoroughly understood through religion.   

----------------------- Page 121-----------------------

  
Born in a predominantly Catholic community, Bishop Barker   
was brought up under the strong influence of his deeply religious   
mother. But even in these surroundings, his response to the Church   
was unusual: at the age of four he attempted to "convert" one of   
his brothers to a more religious life; at the age of five he became   
fascinated with the lives of the saints and particularly those who   
had been martyred; at the age of seven he was impressed by the   
story of Daniel in the lion's den. During these early years he   
donated his spare money to Church collections for missionary   
work "to redeem the heathen child." And by the time he was eight   
years old, he had already determined to do missionary work in   
China. He was influenced in part by an older brother who was   
studying for the priesthood, and even more strongly by the stories   
he had read and heard about saints and martyrs in China: "The   
Chinese were one of the peoples in the world who could make you   
a martyr . . . there I could have great hope to become a martyr."   
  
APPARENT RESISTERS 135   
  
He was a weak and sickly child, but in children's games he loved   
to play the part of the military officer: "I liked to show bravery, in   
contrast with my body, because I was so weak." Although he never   
wavered from his early ambition to become a priest and missionary,   
his childhood imaginings included the wish to be a doctor and a   
military hero as well; and, as he proudly explained to me, he had   
managed in his work in China to be all of these.   
  
During his primary and secondary school days, from about the   
age of eleven through seventeen, his path was not easy. He had   
difficulty sleeping at night ("I could never have soft, deep sleep")   
and was troubled by disturbing dreams in which "I was not free.   
... I could not do as I liked. ... I was hindered even in the   
dreams." During the day he would often feel weak and tired; he   
would fall asleep in class during lessons, and in chapel during   
prayers. He remembers being told that he had "circulatory dif-   
ficulties," although their exact nature was never made clear. But   
he remained active, a leader among other children; and as far as   
his infirmity was concerned, "I tried to ignore it, to do the same   
work as the strong." These difficulties subsided somewhat during   
the long years of seminary training, but they never disappeared   
completely.   
  
In China, he called forth great energies for his missionary work:   
he studied Chinese music and religious rituals in order to in-   
corporate some of them into his Catholic services; he dispensed   
medicine, treated wounds, and offered assistance during the   
famines, droughts, floods, and civil wars; he arranged special meet-   
ings with bandit chiefs in order to safeguard "my Christians," in   
return serving as a guarantor and go-between for the bandits in   
their negotiations with the government. He often suffered from   
fatigue and insomnia, and on one occasion, after a brief visit to   

----------------------- Page 122-----------------------

Europe, he requested that he be transferred to a different area (a   
request which was granted) in order to avoid the "nervous strain '   
of the negotiations. But he otherwise carried on his work without   
interruption, avoiding any outward show of weakness, and refusing   
many opportunities for periods of rest and temporary replacement.   
He became widely known in his inland province, according to   
other Westerners, as a colorful, courageous, able, and dogmatic   
representative of the Catholic faith.   
  
Bishop Barker divided his imprisonment into two main phases:   
  
136 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
the first six weeks of pressures, directed at "personal factors"; and   
the remaining time, "when I realized that the Communist program   
was not against me, but against my religion." During the first   
phase, his captors emphasized "real facts." These included: a de-   
scription of Communist policies in his mission area which he had   
written at the request of an American officer (while he was strongly   
anti-Communist, much of what he described in this report had   
been far from unfavorable, and he felt that it would have been   
better for him if the Communists had actually seen the report   
rather than just hearing about it); and his presence at a meeting   
organized by Japanese occupiers in their attempt to obtain co-   
operation from the missionaries (his sympathies were always with   
the Chinese, and he emphasized the many risks he had taken in   
helping them against the Japanese). Although he felt that these   
incidents were misinterpreted and distorted, he nonetheless re-   
gretted the two actions greatly, and they contributed to a strong   
personal sense of guilt.   
  
He also took the next step, and began to view himself in rela-   
tionship to the Communist doctrine:   
  
I said that imperialism is the parent of pride and acquisitiveness, and   
that I would fight it. I thought that maybe there was imperialism in me.   
  
But during the second phase, as he began to get a better grasp of   
the prison world (he had known very little about Communist   
doctrine or reform methods), he realized that his captors were   
indicting his mission society and his Church as part of an "espi-   
onage network." At this point the trend was reversed, and "I   
mobilized all of my strength for resistance." As he "learned what   
play was going on," he consciously substituted within his mind the   
Catholic religious equivalents of the subjects under discussion:   
  
This saving thought came to me: for the state I substitute God; for the   
people, my Christians; the imperialists' failings, greed and pride, are   
aptly represented by uncharitable self-love and love of pleasure, and the   
"helping" more than takes the place of fraternal admonition. ... It   
was necessary for me to find the proper standpoint in relationship to   
God.   

----------------------- Page 123-----------------------

  
He began to view his imprisonment as a personal religious trial:   
  
APPARENT RESISTORS lyj   
  
I suffered . . . because my self-love had to give way to the love of   
God. . . . One time when the warden spit in my face, I felt pain, but   
it was instantly suppressed. The pain meant I still had self-love . . .   
when you lose self-love, there is almost instant disappearance of pain.   
... In the struggle between the selfish I and God, the selfish I causes   
pain, uncertainty, insecurity, and a troubled heart. When you are   
wholly relying on God, you calm down and there is a quietude and   
peace that you feel. . . . When this happened I could feel my inner   
happiness increasing. ... I was thankful to them for a rare occasion   
to live my religion.   
  
Meditating whenever he could, he thought of the early Roman   
martyrs and of Christ himself on the Cross, reconstructing in his   
own way the New Testament passage which applied to his situation:   
  
You will be persecuted. People will kill you like a dog, but do not be   
afraid. They can kill your body but not your soul. When they press you   
with arguments . . . give them the answer. The Holy Spirit will give   
you the answer.   
  
He sought to retain this reversal in symbols throughout his im-   
prisonment: "I would agree to personal shortcomings because I   
had many shortcomings regarding God."   
  
At the same time, he attempted to avoid involvement in the   
re-education program as much as he could, pleading poor eyesight   
(his glasses had been broken soon after his imprisonment and were   
never replaced), difficulty in hearing (also partially true), and an   
incomplete knowledge of written Chinese.   
  
He also tried to maintain his sense of the humorous and the   
human, as the following incidents suggest. Once an intelligent   
fellow-prisoner, after subjecting Bishop Barker to a grueling in-   
dividual session of "informal help" shook his head and said,   
quoting a Chinese proverb, "Talking to you is like playing a violin   
before a cow." Back in the group, Bishop Barker was asked about   
the session, and whimsically reported, "He has been playing music   
to a horse" — stimulating in his helper the response which he had   
hoped it would bring out — "I must be making some progress." For,   
as Bishop Barker explained to me, "A horse is more sensitive to   
music than a cow."   
  
Similarly, he reported on the efforts of a cellmate with a strong   
but brief argument: "He played a big drum, but he ran away." And   
  
138 THOUGHT REFORM   
  

----------------------- Page 124-----------------------

at a lighter moment, his cellmates temporarily joined the game   
and asked him "Which instrument?" another less forceful cellmate   
had "played," to which Bishop Barker replied, "He played a small   
drum."   
  
When pressed for his "thoughts," his humor was tinged with the   
poignancy of the prisoner's position: "I am a man who does not   
exist. I cannot have any thoughts." And frequently, when he was   
being abused by his cellmates, he would appeal to their sense of   
personal ethics: "I can endure this, but I wonder how you can   
endure it. Does your conscience allow this evil treatment?" This   
last approach especially would sometimes bring at least temporary   
relief. Bishop Barker also felt that his advanced age was responsible   
for a certain amount of moderation, sometimes expressed in the   
backhanded prison vernacular as an admonishment for his stub-   
bornness: "You have no pity for your old bones."   
  
The occasional presence of other Westerners, including priests,   
was also of great importance to him, although he had little op-   
portunity for direct exchange with them. Once, however, after a   
particularly difficult day, he recited a German poem to a fellow-   
European in the cell: "The day was hot, the battle was fierce, the   
evening quiet — it will be cool in the night." This poem helped   
him to express his feelings and rally his strength; but since he was   
overheard, it also resulted in severe criticism for "cursing us in a   
foreign tongue."   
  
Despite his friendly, personal approach to other prisoners, Bishop   
Barker was careful to avoid real intimacy with them:   
  
They would say, "This Number Four is not a good comrade. He remains   
separate from us. It must be because of his imperialist pride." They   
wanted me to sit down with the other prisoners and to have them as   
comrades. But I was afraid that if I did this, my resistance would grow   
weaker.   
  
Although he made many concessions, his imprisonment — con-   
trary to most cases — ended on a note of resistance. During his last   
five months, he received his most severe treatment, including   
handcuffs and chains — which he referred to as "decorations" —   
directed toward extracting a final "espionage" confession: "my   
repentance and witness letter." He doggedly refused to follow the   
judge's suggested version, insisting that untrue accusations involving    
  
APPARENT RESISTORS I39   
  
his colleagues and his Church be left out; he finally agreed to a   
compromise version consisting only of "facts" — somewhat exag-   
gerated, but mainly concerned with his own behavior. The prison   
officials, rather than hold him longer to extract a more desirable   
confession, were apparently determined to release him at this time   
for reasons of their own. He left with the feeling that he had   

----------------------- Page 125-----------------------

forced the government to back down and had successfully de-   
fended the integrity of the Church.   
  
He arrived in Hong Kong, gaunt but confident, expressing to his   
friends the conviction that he had successfully met a severe trial.   
He experienced much less fear and suspiciousness than most, and   
the physician who first examined him described him as a "superior   
person," much more composed than others he had examined im-   
mediately after the same ordeal.   
  
When he spoke to me three months later, he retained this ex-   
pressed feeling of victory: "In the long run, I have won." He was   
strongly critical of the "diabolical" Communist world he had seen,   
and specifically condemned its manipulation of people:   
  
The Communists drop a net all over the country, closing the frontiers.   
Then the net is dropped over an individual person, and he loses his   
freedom of movement and must follow their wishes.   
  
But as we talked more, it became clear that he had some inner   
doubts about the completeness of his victory. He spoke whimsically   
of being "almost converted" during the early period of imprison-   
ment, criticized himself for having then gone "too far," and gave   
me the general impression that he felt very uncomfortable about   
whatever concessions he had made.   
  
This impression was confirmed when he showed me a summary   
of his prison experiences which he had prepared. In attempting to   
convey, in characteristic tongue-in-cheek style, the full impact of   
Communist arguments upon missionaries, he revealed perhaps   
more than he meant to:   
  
And now, like a monster from out of the abyss, the most fearful realiza-   
tion dawned: you, a missionary, the herald of the Gospel, are not you a   
messenger of the imperialistic conquerors, their pioneer, on account of   
your ethnological and industrial reports on your mission land? And after   
the occupation of your mission land, you go on rendering the conquer-   
ors many different services. And take your mission work as a whole: does   
  
140 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
it not now prove to be a big, long, and heavy sin? And the question   
whether your mission activity has been of more harm or good to the   
people answers itself. But because you grew up in imperialistic ideolo-   
gies, it 'has never until now occurred to you how much you have been   
of help in the enslaving and the exploitation of a people which for-   
merly enjoyed liberty. Yes, the scope of your corrupting activities is en-   
larged: what you do, your colleagues do. Thus you cannot escape the   
fact that your society and your mission ought to be regarded as spy   
centers, sending out reports to both headquarters, and that Rome be-   
comes the world center, from where imperialist governments draw their   
perverting information. ... as proof that you now condemn this   

----------------------- Page 126-----------------------

process, you must at once give full information about the spy activities   
of your society, of your mission, as of Rome. By doing this you acquire   
the mentality of the new regime, which alone will make you realize   
the sins of your past life, and those of your comrades. Only this men-   
tality will give you true guidance for your future work.   
  
Even as he condemned the Communists, he was deeply im-   
pressed with their power and energy, and compared these favor-   
ably to the shortcomings of the West in general and of the Catholic   
Church in particular:   
  
The Communists have tremendous enthusiasm in their outright devo-   
tion to their doctrine. . . . What they believe, they do. . . . We are   
divided between doctrine and practice. . . . There is a discrepancy   
between religious life and doctrine. Therefore we are weak. . . . They   
are superior to us in carrying out their actions. . . . They have dialectic   
and a strange use of their proofs. . . . They have a keen instinct for   
finding out what each man may be doing against bis own creed and   
his work. ... I don't know where human beings can find such proofs.   
  
In resorting to the demonology of Catholic theology for his   
analysis of Communist strength, he expressed very little personal   
bitterness toward his former captors. Rather, he emphasized their   
antireligious (and therefore "unnatural") character as a cause of   
their ultimate failure:   
  
Communists' faces are hard, reflecting cultivated hatred, insecurity with   
each other, and irritations. They are unsatisfied regarding human nature   
. . . because the essential relationship between the Creator and man   
is unsatisfied. . . . Their leaders have the greatest authority ever filled   
by human beings, but they obtained this authority by taking it them-   
selves, without the authority of God. . . . They are hanging in air   
without foundation, and the frame is too large for the image. ... Al-   
though they aim to make people satisfied and happy by work and sacri-   
fice, in the long run they destroy this goal. . . . They rely only on   
  
APPARENT RESISTERS 141   
  
nature without God or any spiritual forces, but they do so many things   
against nature.   
  
But despite all of this, he was struck by the similarity ("the   
identical methods, the identical terminology") between these   
Communist conversion techniques and those of his own Catholic   
Church. He also emphasized, however, what was for him the crucial   
difference between the two: "The state demands such a complete   
change and turnover of mind as we only allow God to demand."   
He summed up his admiration-tinged condemnation of the Com-   
munists in the simple statement, "They lie so truly."   
  
He extended his analysis to the sources of his own courage and   
resistance, dividing these into the religious, the ethical ("for   

----------------------- Page 127-----------------------

others") and the personal. He felt he was weakest in the last   
category, and for this he felt a certain amount of guilt and shame;   
but he believed that this "natural defect" was compensated for by   
his strength in the other two areas, and particularly by the necessary   
strengthening of his "religious motive": "I had to become more   
religious or else give way to the Communists." As a consequence,   
he felt that the entire experience had left him "more separated from   
the outside world than before," because of his "deeper religious   
life." Always important in his evaluation of his personal experience   
was the theological significance he attributed to it. "In my whole   
life, I have always given suffering a higher meaning. . . . always   
recalling, 'the blood of the martyrs is the seed of new Christians'."   
  
These religious preoccupations did not diminish his lively re-   
sponses to life around him. His enthusiasm for China and for the   
Chinese was always evident, and he was greatly affected by a short   
trip he took to a neighboring island whose landscape reminded him   
of the interior of China. He enjoyed wine with his meals, and was   
quick with a spirited metaphor at any time. He was impatient with   
clerical colleagues who were either dull or overly propagandistic. He   
criticized American women, both on moral grounds ("They show   
to everyone what only their husbands should see"), and for an   
implied defect in sensuality ("They are like a lukewarm shower   
bath"). He always welcomed psychological interpretations from   
me: "You are better in the natural. I am better in the supernatural,"   
and asked for names of books from which he might learn the   
principles of psychiatric interviewing, which he thought would be   
  
142 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
useful for his religious work. At the same time, he repeatedly urged   
me in my future work to encourage my patients to deepen them-   
selves in their religion, whatever it might be; and he was not above   
a delicate pursuit of my own soul — recommending to me, and then   
producing the next day, a book written by a psychiatrist describing   
his spiritual journey from Judaism to psychoanalysis to Cathol-   
icism. 1   
  
Toward the end of our talks, he summed up his feelings about   
his experience once more in an affirmative way: "My constant feel-   
ing is I have done good. ... I have nothing to forget." But once   
more I felt that while part of him believed this, another part of   
him required its expression in order to quiet guilty doubts. At that   
time, his prescription for the future was essentially a spiritual one:   
"I am convinced that we can resist Communism only if we are one   
hundred per cent adherents to God."   
  
I also saw him six months later, about ten months after his   
release, when he was passing through Hong Kong after a period of   
rest and travel, and after having lectured and given sermons on his   
experience. Then he spoke in a different key. He talked of the in-   
evitability of war, implying that we might as well "risk it now"; and   

----------------------- Page 128-----------------------

he severely attacked the alternative path of negotiation and modera-   
tion: "You do not sit down with the Devil to discuss how to save   
your soul." In developing this point of view, his explanation took   
a strange turn to economics: "America has lost many of her overseas   
markets — so something will happen — and this war must result   
anyway." In his activities, he continued to dedicate himself to what   
he called the "spiritual mobilization of Christians."   
  
To what extent did Bishop Barker resist thought reform? Cer-   
tainly, he was impressively successful in accomplishing what every   
imprisoned Catholic priest attempted to do (and what priests have   
always attempted in these circumstances): to maintain a sense of   
inner theological experience rather than surrender to the influence   
<of those who would change him. His emotional strength upon re-   
lease, his clear preservation of his own ideals and his condemnation   
of those of the Communists, his capacity to place his entire experi-   
ence within the framework of his own theological idiom — all were   
very real demonstrations of strength and of resistance.   
  
Nonetheless, there was clear evidence that his theological struc-   
  
APPARENT RESISTORS 143   
  
ture had also been penetrated by significant thought reform in-   
fluences. His repeated need to affirm his "victory" had some of the   
quality of whistling in the dark, especially in the light of his awe   
and even admiration for the Communists' single-mindedness and   
"superhuman" (even if demonic) energies. His own written "fear-   
ful realization" statement expressed the depth to which one part   
of him had entered into the Communist idiom, the extent to which   
he had been made to feel guilty on their terms. His preparation of   
this statement was in fact his way of attempting to purge himself   
of this unwanted reform influence. Finally, there is his remarkable   
statement about economics a few months later — an extreme anti-   
Communist view, to be sure, but at the same time an orthodox   
Marxist analysis undoubtedly derived from his prison experience.   
  
Bishop Barker — in his exposure to Communist indoctrination,   
and in his long life before this — had struggled with inner demons   
of his own. On the one hand, his life is a remarkable study in   
continuity. From the age of three to seventy, the direction of his   
life and of his view of the world never changed, only expanded.   
Moreover, he was one of those fortunate men who could achieve   
the unachievable, and live out fully during his adult life the imagina-   
tive fantasies of his childhood — which may not be, as Freud   
claimed, the only form of true happiness, but which is certainly one   
of the best paths to self-realization. His was undoubtedly an identity   
of great strength and consistency, combining fundamentalist ab-   
solutism with a well-developed worldliness and a taste for the   
human drama.   
  
What, then, were his demons? They were his feelings of weak-   

----------------------- Page 129-----------------------

ness, of being unable to accomplish what he so wished to do, his   
self -doubts (and possibly even lapses of faith), and the sense of   
guilt and shame which accompany such doubt. They were, in short,   
his negative identity.   
  
His adolescent identity crisis was specifically his struggle with   
these demons, and he overcame them through subordination of   
self to the greater authority of Church and God. Like Vincent and   
Luca, he found his solution in an absorbing profession; in terms of   
belief and ideology, it was attained more by rigorous reinforcement   
of what already consciously existed than by the use of some new   
principle from the outside or of something long-buried within.   
  
Although this ideological solution was certainly a successful one,   
  
144 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
the demons frequently re-emerged and gave rise, in later life, to   
anxiety, fatigue, and despair; and in a man as sensual as Bishop   
Barker, probably to considerable sexual temptation as well. Men are   
perhaps at their most heroic when fighting such inner demons,   
however, and Bishop Barker never succumbed. Instead, he used   
his form of totalism — his urge toward absolute surrender to an all-   
powerful supernatural force — as a means of taming them. Totalism   
was not, as it was with Miss Darrow, a threat to his self-affirmation.   
Quite the reverse; it was the power behind his most cherished self-   
image, the emotional counterpart of his ideal of martyrdom.   
  
But the Communists would not meet him on this ground. By   
focusing upon personal weaknesses, and by creating a situation in   
which martyrdom was impossible, they denied him his strongest   
inner support. His early susceptibility to their influence was due to   
their circumventing his totalism and making contact with his per-   
sonal demons of guilt and self-doubt. And I believe this is what   
Bishop Barker really meant when he spoke of the alliance between   
the Communists and the demons: he was expressing in theological   
symbols what he knew from profound psychological experience —   
the alliance between the undermining pressures of thought reform   
and his own negative identity, for him a particularly dangerous   
entente. It created an inroad for thought reform influence; and with   
his degree of totalism, the emotional extremes of Communist   
ideology and behavior held a seductive appeal. The process was, of   
course, enhanced by his painful awareness of having committed   
actions (the report for the American officer, and the attendance at   
the Japanese-run meetings) which violated both Communist law   
and his own moral standards.   
  
He could protect himself from seduction only by reaffirming his   
tie to the Church, by reclaiming his totalism as a source of de-   
fensive strength. This was possible for him once he felt that the   
Church itself was under attack. Then he was able, as he always   
had been, to bring his inner demons under control, even make them   

----------------------- Page 130-----------------------

work for him. By placing his negative identity squarely within the   
Catholic perspective, he could denounce his selfishness to his   
heart's content, as a prisoner was supposed to do, and through the   
denunciations move closer to the Catholic Church and create   
distance between himself and the Communists. At the same time   
he could also call upon that humane and flexible part of himself   
  
APPARENT RESISTERS 145   
  
which had always lived side-by-side with his Catholic fundamen-   
talism and totalism, and which had contributed so much to his   
stature as a human being.   
  
He was still in the midst of this reclaiming process when I saw   
him, simultaneously accentuating his totalism, and re-emphasizing   
its alignment with his Catholic supernatural identity. The thought   
reform seduction remained a constant threat and gave several   
evidences of its unconscious presence. Yet despite Bishop Barker's   
inner doubts about his "victory," it was by no means entirely a   
hollow one. He had resisted thought reform's disruptive pressures   
more effectively than most.   
  
Methods of Resistance   
  
Bishop Barker illustrates dramatically the psychological strengths   
and weaknesses of the apparent resisters. The same factors are   
present to some extent in all prisoners, but in the apparent re-   
sisters these strengths are most effective and the weaknesses most   
dangerous. These methods of resistance (for that is what both the   
strengths and weaknesses are) may be classified under five main   
headings:   
  
The first form of resistance is the acquisition of a sense of under-   
standing, a theory about what is going on, an awareness of being   
manipulated. In Bishop Barker's case, this understanding was not   
immediate; and in a man of his intellectual and psychological   
breadth, we may assume that it was his "demons" which were re-   
sponsible for the delay. But once he began to grasp "which play   
was on" it could become for him just that — something of a con-   
trived drama, by no means completely artificial, but one in which   
he could do his "acting" while keeping in touch with his own   
spiritual tradition. In his explanation, he undoubtedly oversimpli-   
fied the importance of this understanding, but it was important   
nonetheless. Each of my subjects formulated his own psychological,   
theological, or philosophical concepts to explain the experience to   
himself, even while he was going through it. These theories offered   
protection: they gave each prisoner a capacity to predict what was   
coming next, a sense of anticipation; 2 and they provided him one   
of the rewards of knowledge, a sense of control. This understanding,   
always partial at best, cannot offer complete immunization; but as   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   

----------------------- Page 131-----------------------

  
Bishop Barker and many others demonstrated, a grasp of the   
techniques being used and the emotions being called forth helps   
to dispel the terrifying fear of the unknown and the sense of   
complete helplessness — two great stimulators of human anxiety   
upon which thought reform depends. The prisoner is thus enabled   
to mobilize his defenses and bring into play the other methods of   
resistance.   
  
The second important resistance technique is the avoidance of   
emotional participation; in other words, the prisoner remains as   
much as possible outside the communication system of thought   
reform. Bishop Barker was doing this when he emphasized his dif-   
ficulties in sight and hearing, and his limited knowledge of written   
Chinese. Others, who had lived for shorter periods of time in   
China, managed to resist learning even spoken Chinese while in   
prison; still others, at their own request, were allowed to study   
Marxist writings or Russian, and thereby avoided more intense   
personal involvement in confession and re-education. Bishop Barker   
went even further. In his human relationships he steered clear of   
the kind of intimacy which would have drawn him more deeply   
into the group structure of the cell and integrated him more firmly   
into the prison world. This in turn enabled him to do what was   
most important of all — to maintain a private inner world of values,   
judgments, and symbols, and thereby keep a measure of inde -   
pendence from the ever-pressing environment. 8   
  
Since a prisoner could never fully avoid participation, the next   
best form of resistance was to adopt a neutralizing attitude, one   
which deflated rather than contested, and which thereby took the   
sting out of the assaults. Hostile rejoinders gained a prisoner little,   
and in fact brought about even more devastating pressures. But   
humor or humane stoicism (both of which Bishop Barker demon-   
strated) put officials and cellmates in a difficult psychological posi-   
tion.   
  
A show of humor had the effect of breaking the general tension   
and dissipating the anxiety and guilt which hung heavy in the en-   
vironment. As one subject expressed it, "Since the judge is a   
tragedian before you, if you keep a smile this protects you, because   
the impressiveness of the tragedy is avoided." This was not often   
possible, as the same subject was quick to add. But when it was   
possible to use it, humor was a way to express a tone contrary to   
  
APPARENT RESISTORS 147   
  
thought reform's self-righteousness, an implication that the intense   
doings of the moment could be made fun of because they were   
merely a speck on the great human canvas. Since humor is a   
shared emotion, it can create a bond of sympathy (as it did for   
Bishop Barker) independent of and frequently antithetical to the   
world of reform.   

----------------------- Page 132-----------------------

  
Humane stoicism, the turning of the other cheek in the face of   
abuse, is, as Bishop Barker made clear, an attitude extremely dif-   
ficult to maintain in the prison environment. It is a form of passive   
resistance in the Gandhian tradition; but a prisoner can never   
flaunt the resistance, and even his passivity, or lack of enthusiasm in   
any direction, is highly suspect. Moreover, it requires unusual dedi-   
cation to a supernatural or humanitarian ideal. Yet it may produce   
startling effects, even to the extent of so dominating the cell for a   
moment that harsh behavior suddenly seems shameful in everyone's   
eyes. It is not long, of course, before there is a return to the usual   
prison standards; but the impact of this stoicism outlasts the brief   
moment of its effectiveness. It reaffirms — in the eyes of the stoic   
prisoner and his cellmates — a moral position superior to the   
grandiose moral claims of thought reform.   
  
The steadfastness of humane stoicism is related to the fourth   
and generally most important resistance technique, that of identity   
reinforcement. Bishop Barker's major way of resisting thought re-   
form was to make it a Catholic theological struggle, rather than a   
Communist remolding. He sought always to maintain himself as a   
priest struggling against his selfishness, rather than as a stubborn   
imperialist spy. To do this, he needed a continuous awareness of   
his own world of prayer, Catholic ritual, missionary experience and   
Western cultural heritage; with nothing around him to encourage   
it, this awareness could come only from within. His behavior re-   
sembled Father Luca's conscious recollection of the people and   
places which had special meaning for him. This kind of identity   
reinforcement was for any prisoner the essence of self-protection,   
both against reform influence and against always-threatening psy-   
chological disintegration.   
  
One priest expressed this very succinctly:   
  
To resist . . . you must affirm your personality whenever there is the   
opportunity. . . . When I was obliged to speak my views about the   
  
I48 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
government, I would each time begin, "I am a priest. I believe in   
religion." I said it strongly every time.   
  
This statement was perhaps a retrospective exaggeration of his self-   
assertion, but there was no doubt that so personal a reminder   
served him well.   
  
A European professor used a more creative approach. He some-   
how managed during moments when pressures were relatively re-   
laxed to make a series of drawings representing precious moments   
in his past: a mother and baby, a boy before a Christmas tree, a   
university city, a young man on a romantic stroll with his fiancee.   
He also wrote a brief, idealized account of the incident in his life   

----------------------- Page 133-----------------------

each drawing represented. He worked on both the drawings and the   
essays during moments when he was off by himself in a comer of   
the cell or with other Westerners; and they became so precious to   
him that he smuggled them out of the prison at great risk and   
proudly displayed them to me during our interviews. They re-   
established for him the world in which he wished to exist: "I could   
escape the horrible world around me and move in a world whose   
values I agreed with."   
  
The first four methods of resistance depend upon strength — ego   
strength, strength of character, strength of identity. Another aspect   
of Bishop Barker's response may be termed pseudo strength, and   
this method of resistance is a potential psychological danger. I am   
referring to his inability to come to conscious terms with thought   
reform influences, and his need instead to make use of the psycho-   
logical mechanisms of denial and repression in order to keep from   
himself the recognition of undue "weakness." In this pattern he   
differed, not only from the obviously confused, but also from the   
apparent converts (although both of these groups of prisoners,   
especially the latter, had much of their own to hide from them-   
selves). Bishop Barker shared with other apparent resisters a sig-   
nificant attraction to the reform program; his repeated protesta-   
tions of resistance and his strong condemnations of Communism   
expressed his attempts to cast off this attraction. The potential   
danger of this pseudo strength lies in the effects of a highly unac-   
ceptable, and at the same time completely unresolved, set of   
emotions.   
  
Thus, when Bishop Barker advocated "war now" with the Com-   
  
APPARENT RESISTERS I49   
  
munists — at the same time justifying his view by Communist   
theory — he was attempting to eradicate these compelling thought   
reform influences (his new demons) which so deeply threatened   
his sense of who he was and what he believed. He was, in effect,   
saying: "If we can destroy all of the demons in the world, it will   
eliminate those within me without my having to recognize that   
they have been there."   
  
The apparent resisters characteristically combine these real and   
pseudo strengths. Their form of totalism, along with their habitual   
use of denial and repression, create a paradoxical situation in which   
those who have been least influenced by thought reform uncon-   
sciously feel themselves to be most in danger of being overwhelmed   
by its influence. They struggle continually against a breakthrough of   
despair.   
  
Survival and Influence   
  
We have been discussing in this, and in the previous two   
chapters, problems of indvidual thought reform experiences, and   

----------------------- Page 134-----------------------

especially the problems of survival and influence. The two are   
closely related: for a prisoner to survive — hold on to physical and   
psychic life — he must avoid being totally overwhelmed by environ-   
mental influence. From the standpoint of identity, survival and   
resistance to influence converge, at least in an absolute sense: one   
cannot have his deepest feelings about who and what he is totally   
replaced, and still survive in a nonpsychotic state.   
  
But one can go quite far in permitting his identity to give way to   
outside influence, and still function adequately, both physically   
and psychologically. Indeed, in thought reform, a prisoner had to   
submit to some degree of environmental influence as the price of   
survival. 4 This was especially clear in the cases of Professor Castorp   
and Miss Darrow, both of whom were aware that they had bartered   
the acceptance of reform views for survival. This bargain was also   
struck by prisoners like Bishop Barker, even though more of the   
bartering occurred outside of awareness. To survive thought reform   
and retain absolutely no trace of its influences was an ideal impos-   
sible to achieve — whether the ideal was held by the prisoner him-   
self, his colleagues, or the shocked onlookers of the outside world.   
  
This paradoxical relationship between survival and influence al-   
  
150 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
lows a better understanding of the Westerners' performances during   
imprisonment. As far as survival is concerned, these men and   
women, when put under extreme forms of stress, were able to sum-   
mon an impressive store of strength and ingenuity. Bishop Barker's   
use of humor, Dr. Vincent's characterological shift from isolation to   
"togetherness," even Father Luca's delusions all were methods of   
survival, as were the confessions and the "reformed" patterns of   
behavior elicited during imprisonment from every prisoner.   
  
Thought reform succeeded with all Westerners in the first of   
its aims, the extraction of an incriminating personal confession,   
because it made this confession a requirement for survival. It fell   
far short of its more ambitious goal of converting Westerners into   
enthusiastic Communist adherents; for although none could avoid   
being profoundly influenced, virtually all prisoners showed a gen-   
eral tendency to revert to what they had been before prison, or at   
least to a modified version of their previous identity. The barter of   
influence for survival which Western prisoners made with their   
reformers turned out to be reasonable enough; only the unreason-   
able demands of their inner voice of conscience made some of these   
Westerners feel that their bargain had been a Faustian one.   
  
One very important question remains: granted the variations in   
external reform pressures, what factors in individual character   
structure are responsible for the differing susceptibilities to thought   
reform influence? I found that it is not so much the specific type   
of character structure which is important, as is the degree of   

----------------------- Page 135-----------------------

balance and integration; not so much who one is as how well one   
is put together. To speak, for instance, of "hysterical" or "obses-   
sive" character types does not help us, since these characterological   
tendencies appear among people in all three categories. Distinguish-   
ing "authoritarian" from "liberal" character traits 5 is a bit more   
useful; but it does not explain why one apparent convert (Miss   
Darrow) falls into the liberal category, and another (Father Simon,   
discussed in Chapter 11) into the authoritarian.   
  
Rather, each tended to be influenced to the degree that his iden-   
tity, whatever it may have been, could be undermined through the   
self-deprecating effects of guilt and shame. This susceptibility in turn   
depended largely upon his balance between flexibility and totalism,   
and their special significance for his character structure. Apparent   
converts shared with apparent resisters a significant amount of   
  
APPARENT RESISTORS 151   
  
totalism; hence both extreme responses. 6 But apparent resisters   
(Bishop Barker) possessed great strength of identity in contrast to   
the apparent converts (Miss Darrow) who tended to show identity   
diffusion. Those among the obviously confused were able to be   
more flexible in experimenting with identity alternatives, without   
feeling the need to totally accept or reject the new influence. This   
is not to say that they were without elements of totalism, any more   
than the apparent resisters were completely devoid of flexibility;   
every character structure has both. It was more a question of degree   
and of lifelong pattern. 7 Some individual cases (Dr. Vincent)   
defy even these broad patterns: his totalism was predominant   
throughout his life and during reform itself, but his idiosyncratic   
identity strength and flexibility were responsible for his ending   
up in the most moderate of the three categories.   
  
Each of the three styles of response had its own psychological   
advantages and disadvantages, as well as its variations. None held a   
monopoly on human limitation, strength, or courage.   
  
CHAPTER   
  
GROUP REFORM:   
  
DOUBLE-EDGED   
LEADERSHIP   
  
A consistent feature of all the cases discussed so far   
has been the isolation of the Western prisoner. Even   
when physically part of a cell group, he was completely re-   
moved from it — emotionally, culturally, and ideologically — until   
he "changed" and adopted its standards. Never did the group sup-   
port him as an individual, or help him to resist the onslaughts of   
thought reform; rather, the group was the agent of thought reform,   
the conveyor of its message.   

----------------------- Page 136-----------------------

  
There was just one exception to this pattern among my Western   
subjects. One all-European group was permitted to reform itself;   
it developed in the process a remarkable series of resistance ploys,   
and at the same time an incomplete immunity to the reform effects   
of these ploys. This group showed a poignant combination of   
solidarity and antagonism, of tortured and tender behavior; its   
story is one of a struggle to maintain group autonomy-in an environ-   
ment specifically geared to prevent the appearance of any such   
autonomy.   
  
This unusual Western group functioned for two-and-one-half   
years, and conducted its thought reform in English. The six men   
  
 15*   
  
GROUP REFORM 153   
  
who were its members for most of its existence averaged close to   
two years of this form of re-education; and each spent at least one   
year with all five of the others. There were several manipulations   
and changes in personnel, so that four additional Westerners spent   
short periods of time in the group; but these men did not play as   
important roles in the group. The Europeans never constituted an   
entire cell by themselves, but were always a subgroup within a   
larger cell which also contained eight Chinese prisoners. A Chinese   
cell chief was always in charge of both subgroups. All the prisoners   
involved — Western and Chinese — were completely occupied during   
these two-and-a-half years with their re-education. Before each   
Westerner joined the group, he had been in prison for at least a   
few months; each had already made some concession to the govern-   
ment's demands, some form of incriminating personal confession.   
  
The Europeans were brought into the cell one by one, for the   
apparent purpose of "helping" each other with their confessions   
and reform. The early pattern was essentially as follows. One   
European who had achieved some degree of adaptation to his en-   
vironment by making a satisfactory confession and taking part in   
the criticism of others would be joined by a second Westerner who   
was still in acute conflict over how much to submit. The influence   
of the adjusted upon the conflicted European would inevitably be   
in the direction of confession and reform, but his motivations for   
this "progressive" influence were complex and uncertain. Always   
present, in combinations only partially understood by himself, were   
a genuine desire to help a fellow Westerner to accept the inevitable;   
an attempt to demonstrate his own "progressiveness" to the authori-   
ties in order to gain "merits" toward release; and the need to   
justify his own self -surrender through bringing a person similar to   
himself into the sphere of those who have already surrendered —   
a way to share guilt, shame, and weakness. All this "helping" pre-   
ceded the existence of a true group structure, and served as a pre-   
liminary softening up for the group re-education process. It also   

----------------------- Page 137-----------------------

set much of the pattern for the complicated personal relationships   
which were later maintained within the group.   
  
The particular people involved in this group brought to it ad-   
ditional sources of friction of a very formidable nature. The group   
eventually included a German physician with ardent Nazi sym-   
pathies, a highly-trained French Jesuit philosopher, a Dutch priest   
  
154 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
of lowly origin, a successful North German merchant, an adventur-   
ous South German businessman, and a French Jesuit science   
teacher. Among such a group, personal, cultural, intellectual, na-   
tional, political, and religious conflicts were always potentially dis-   
ruptive, and were particularly apt to emerge at times when things   
were not going well. The potential conflicts included the German   
versus the Frenchman, the Nazi versus the anti-Nazi, the priest   
versus the layman, the Catholic versus the Protestant, the Jesuit   
priest versus the non-Jesuit, the crude peasant versus the middle-   
class gentleman, the North German versus the Bavarian, the uni-   
versity graduate versus the man of limited education, the profes-   
sional man versus the merchant.   
  
As though this were not enough, these men also had conflicts   
with each other which had existed before imprisonment — some   
personal and social, some ideological — for instance, disagreements   
among priests about whether to stand firm against all Communist   
pressure, or to adapt flexibly to it and accept the Communist-   
sponsored "independent church" movement in China. Members   
of these separate families within the group (priests, Germans, pro-   
fessional men, and so on) tended to support each other on many is-   
sues, but also found themselves in the most severe personality   
clashes; these were sometimes so extreme that the mildest statement   
or action on the part of one automatically became the cause for   
overwhelming resentment on the part of another, and group mem-   
bers often quoted the maxim: "No one is the other man's devil   
like one priest together with another."   
  
Could any cohesion at all develop among such contending and   
unwilling guests? One might easily doubt it. Yet somehow leaders   
did emerge, along with a rather remarkable esprit de corps. In fact,   
the story of this group is really a study in leadership under stress 1   
— leadership not absolute or static, but active and changing. It is   
also a study of group, rather than individual, resistance patterns.   
These patterns reveal much about the group process specifically   
produced by thought reform, as well as something about group   
process in general; they also tell us something about the interplay   
among the personal qualities of a leader, the special demands of   
a milieu, and the behavior of a group.   
  
This group experience can be divided into three phases, each   
identified by a particular atmosphere, and by the domination of   

----------------------- Page 138-----------------------

  
CROUP REFORM 155   
  
one man. To be sure, what happened in one phase also occurred   
to some extent in the others; but the following descriptions record   
what was most characteristic of each phase.   
  
The Academic Phase   
  
When Dr. Bauer, the German physician, arrived in the cell, he   
found there three other Westerners, each struggling to recover   
from severe personal pressures, and all living in an atmosphere of   
great fear.   
  
The first, Mr. Weber, the businessman from Bavaria, had just   
a short time before made an attempt to kill himself, and had also   
experienced delusions and hallucinations; with the help of the other   
two, he was in the process of recovering his faculties. A man of   
extremes, he had lived a life of great heroism and of alcoholic excess,   
always in conflict between his very demanding internal ethics, and   
his intense need to act out his rebellion. In prison, this pattern   
continued: he was at times absolutely unyielding in his resistance,   
at other moments unduly "progressive." Inclined to be petulant   
and moody, he was leaning heavily upon the other two men.   
  
The second, Mr. Kallmann, the North German merchant, had   
also attempted to take his own life a few months before in the   
midst of a severe depression with psychotic features. He had been   
given more time and opportunity to recover, and he had learned   
a "progressive" stance which he tried to convey to Mr. Weber. Mr.   
Kallmann possessed what the others described as "typically Ger-   
man" traits — loyalty, reliability, sentimentality, irascibility. At this   
point, his great fear was expressed in an attitude of extreme submis-   
siveness: "I was so submissive that when going to the water closet,   
they told me I was bending my head too much, and that I might   
run into something."   
  
The third, Father Emile, the French Jesuit scientist, had been a   
great comfort to both of the other two men. He impressed them   
with his outward calm and with his religious devotion, and had   
exerted a particularly strong influence upon Mr. Weber in reviv-   
ing within him the will to live. Father Emile was slow, deliberate,   
and was regarded by the others as "the most sober of us mentally."   
He managed to remain cheerful, even to interject an occasional   
humorous monologue or bawdy story. But he did not possess either   
  
156 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
great intellectual breadth or quick tactical responses; and he was   
still under great personal pressure because much in his case was   
considered to be "unsolved."   
  

----------------------- Page 139-----------------------

Dr. Bauer's arrival heralded a change in fortune for this oppressed   
trio. Having been subjected to relatively minor pressures, his at-   
titude was still one of confidence, and his entry was an injection   
of strength. As Mr. Weber expressed it: "He arrived like a breath   
of fresh air . . . He still had guts."   
  
Very soon after his arrival the four men were instructed to   
study together in English, since none of them had an extensive   
knowledge of spoken or written Chinese. They were to follow the   
usual procedure — reading from Communist documents, criticism,   
and analytic self-criticism — under the general direction of the Eng-   
lish-speaking Chinese cell chief. Thus the Westerners' group re-   
education began.   
  
For the first three months, the pressures from above were relatively   
mild. The prison officials had apparently not yet fully worked out   
a system for the foreigners to follow, and the cell chief himself was   
notably easygoing, almost friendly. Although he met daily with   
prison officials, he did not seem to be greatly pressed about the   
behavior of the Europeans. Thus he demanded of them only that   
they maintain an attitude of study — without exercising any great   
control over what it was they were studying.   
  
The four Westerners took advantage of this situation, and began   
to organize their resistance. ("It was then that our group opinion   
formed.") They went through the motions of reading and dis-   
cussing Communist material for just a few minutes at the beginning   
of each study period. Then, still maintaining a strict outer decorum,   
they made use of their varied intellectual backgrounds to discuss   
principles of philosophy, religion, science, and business practice.   
Further, they pooled their knowledge to evolve a critique of the   
Communist position. As Dr. Bauer explained: "We developed   
the concept that modern science completely disproved Marxist   
materialism, and that modern science was forced to recognize a   
divine being."   
  
No one among the four Westerners had any official status as   
leader, but Dr. Bauei soon assumed unofficial hegemony. His in-   
tact emotional state was a big factor in his doing so, but his intel-   
lectual and psychological equipment specifically suited him for   
  
GROUP REFORM 1 57   
  
this role. He was by far the most knowledgeable of the group, pos-   
sessing a great fund of information in the natural and social sciences   
which far transcended his medical training. He put his extraordinary   
memory to good use in bringing facts and principles to the group   
discussions. His unusual didactic skill enabled him to command the   
interest of the other group members over prolonged periods of time.   
Further, he was happiest when dominating and teaching others,   
since this helped him to reinforce his tight control over his own   
anxiety, and over his repressed moral conflicts and self-doubts. His   

----------------------- Page 140-----------------------

general psychological integration, and hard core of personal and   
national identity (including the exaggerated German nationalism of   
the expatriate) enabled him to articulate his firm convictions with   
great persuasive force. His tendency toward romantic nostalgia   
frequently led to enjoyable group discussions of childhood memories   
and idealized past experience. During most of his life, he had been   
quick to view anyone who disagreed with him as a personal "enemy";   
in prison he was much more flexible in adapting himself to other   
Westerners against the "common enemy."   
  
His influence largely shaped most of the group practices — and   
his influence was overwhelmingly in the direction of resistance.   
Throughout the group's existence he was considered the most "re-   
actionary" of the Western prisoners. He repeatedly expressed to   
the group his opinions that the imprisonment was essentially a   
"police action" in which the Communists sought to obtain maxi-   
mum information from everyone, that the officials were not un-   
realistic enough to expect genuine conversions from Westerners,   
and that their release would have nothing to do with their "prog-   
ress" in reform. He illustrated his point of view by drawing a carrot-   
and-donkey cartoon in which the Communist rider holds out on a   
stick the promise of release (carrot) before the ever-struggling   
prisoner (donkey). He agreed with the others that it was neces-   
sary to tell everything about one's self that could be politically   
incriminating, and to make only statements acceptable to the Com-   
munist point of view when on public display. But he insisted that   
the small group of Westerners counteract the reform process by   
continually discussing with each other their true beliefs and their   
tactical maneuvers. "After following the correct platform for a   
while, taking notes, admitting our faults, and so on, we would say,   
'Enough, boys,' and then talk frankly."   
  
158 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
Dr. Bauer's influence in the group did not go completely un-   
resisted. The others were fearful that the group might be broken up,   
and each Westerner individually forced to confess to the decep-   
tion — a gamble which Dr. Bauer felt was worth talcing. Mr. Kall-   
mann feared that "they might use drugs or special treatments to   
get out from us what was really in our hearts"; he tended to be   
more cautious and "progressive," even when he was with other   
Westerners, and he was critical of Dr. Bauer because "he did not   
understand the fundamental need to submit." Mr. Weber also had   
doubts, feeling it was necessary to "put your cards on the table,"   
and was at times unwilling, and other times unable, to maintain   
the subterfuge. Father Emile, although willing to go along, was   
at times slow to grasp the method.   
  
Group members had other, more personal criticisms of Bauer:   
of his overbearing manner and need to be all-knowing ("I couldn't   
understand why, because if I knew as much as he knew, I wouldn't   
worry about not knowing something occasionally"); of his attitude   

----------------------- Page 141-----------------------

of superiority, especially on a racial (Nazi) basis toward the Chinese   
("He has a brilliant brain, but in regard to tactfulness there is space   
for improvement"); of his demand for special privileges — extra   
blankets and added space in the cell, officially condoned because of   
the "cardiac condition" which his medical knowledge enabled him   
to feign. His Western fellow-prisoners, from whom he also kept   
this subterfuge, could not object to the situation, but they did resent   
the arrogant fashion in which he demanded these rights. Of even   
more concern to the other three Westerners was Bauer's "care-   
lessness" and "rascal spirit"; his tendency to take what were, in their   
eyes, unnecessary chances out of sheer bravado. They exerted great   
pressure upon him to change his ways, and they succeeded in con-   
vincing him to behave more moderately for the sake of the group.   
  
Despite his shortcomings, they found Bauer to be a very "good   
comrade," unusually patient and skillful in aiding them individually,   
and "a man whom you can rely on in very difficult circumstances."   
They admired his intellect, and they greatly valued the calming   
and strengthening effect which they all acknowledged he had upon   
their previously beleaguered group. This first phase was by far the   
most untroubled and unthreatening. The group was under no great   
pressure from without; and the potential sources of friction within   
did not often materialize because all recognized the importance   
  
CROUP REFORM 159   
  
of mating small personal concessions in order to maintain the group   
structure which they had come to treasure.   
  
Bauer's controversial but effective presence had made this co-   
hesion possible; and he in turn drew much of his personal strength   
from his alternative mystique of Nazism. He was a strong leader,   
if not always for the right reasons. In the light of what followed,   
the Westerners looked back over these three "academic" months   
as near-idyllic.   
  
Phase of Reform   
  
The dramatic entrance of Father Benet, the Jesuit philosopher,   
ushered in a new and disturbing series of events. He had been trans-   
ferred from another cell, in what was for him a demotion, as he   
had previously been a cell chief. He was under fire partly for dis-   
ciplinary violations, which were always dealt with firmly, as well   
as for an offense considered much more serious. A Chinese Catholic   
prisoner had tricked Benet into hearing a religious confession in   
the cell, and then had denounced him, since this form of religious   
practice was strictly prohibited in the prison. The struggle to which   
he was subjected upon reaching the new cell was aimed at making   
him do what for a Catholic priest is unthinkable — reveal the details   
of this religious confession. Chinese prisoners led the attack, but   
the Westerners had to take part. Bauer describes the scene which   
followed:   

----------------------- Page 142-----------------------

  
They manhandled him . . . pulled his beard, and kicked him in the   
chest. He screamed to the man who accused him, "You know I am   
not allowed to tell. You tell it yourself." But the other man was silent.   
... It was difficult for us, too. We were in a rage. Kallmann was close   
to tears, fimile clenched his fists. I was the same.   
  
A way out was finally achieved when Father Ben6t, after much   
insisting, succeeded in obtaining a release from the Chinese pris-   
oner to reveal the contents of the confession. But after this incident   
the Westerners never returned to the relative calm of their academic   
phase. Life in their cell had changed.   
  
Pressures from above dictated a more intense program of per-   
sonal reform, and a new cell chief, much more observant and vin-   
dictive than his predecessor (he had a great deal in the way of "re-   
  
l6o THOUGHT REFORM   
  
actionary" past affiliations to live down himself), was brought in   
to enforce this policy change. Father Benet was put through a   
series of severe struggles and "thought examinations" during the   
next few weeks; at the same time he was made "study leader" of   
the small Western group — a post for which he qualified because   
of his fluency in written and spoken Chinese, and his previous   
standing as a leading Western "progressive." Now the foreigners   
"studied" sometimes as a separate five-man group, sometimes with   
their eight Chinese cellmates. In either case, the new cell chief   
kept a close eye on their activities. Benet assumed a position of   
great responsibility, interpreting all of the study materials from   
Chinese to English for his Western fellow-prisoners, and answering   
to the authorities for what went on among them.   
  
He brought to this task a form of leadership completely dif-   
ferent from Bauer's approach, startling in its demands and its   
performance. He expressed to the other Westerners his firm con-   
viction that the only way for them to earn their release was to throw   
themselves energetically into the reform process. This meant stop-   
ping at nothing to convince the officials of the extent of personal   
reform. He set an impressive example with his own behavior — his-   
trionic gestures and expressions of guilt, repentance, and self-dep-   
recation. He went to such extremes as describing intimate details   
of his own sexual life, including self-stimulation and affairs with   
women. His Western cellmates were themselves unsure of the truth   
of these sexual "confessions"; some suspected that Benet derived   
a good deal of satisfaction in their telling, and all were aware of the   
effect they had of damaging his relationship to the Catholic priest-   
hood. At times, however, his lurid stories of personal misbehavior   
were clearly fabricated, intended — as were his expressions of opinions   
he knew to be "incorrect" — to supply more sins to repent, additional   
material for his demonstrative confessions. As one of the other   
Westerners said:   

----------------------- Page 143-----------------------

  
He confessed everything, exaggerated everything. He admitted all blame   
with an empty heart. He was very submissive, fully and deeply recog-   
nizing faults, showing himself a repentant sinner. He had a lively face,   
lots of grimaces. He was a marvelous actor.   
  
He expected similar behavior from the Westerners under his   
direction, and exerted great pressure upon them in the form of   
  
GROUP REFORM l6l   
  
criticisms and sharply-worded rebukes. Not only did he insist upon   
the prerogatives of his official position, but he also felt that as a   
priest it was his duty to do everything possible to help others in   
the cell. With religions procedures strictly forbidden, this help   
had to take other forms — and the ironic situation arose in which   
a Jesuit saw as his priestly duty the need to "help" others along the   
path to Communist reform. To be sure, Benet initially presented his   
approach as a technique, a means of obtaining early release and   
thereby preserving values. But his extreme behavior — and particu-   
larly his insistence that the Westerners maintain their "progres-   
sive" enthusiasms and pro-Communist sentiments even among   
themselves — obscured this original purpose. The distinction be-   
tween real and make-believe was soon lost — certainly to the other   
Westerners in the group, and apparently to Benet himself.   
  
Despite this "progressive" approach, Benet was severely treated   
by the cell chief, and constantly accused of "shielding" his fellow   
Westerners. And indeed, according to the Europeans, he did on   
many occasions absorb great punishment himself rather than ex-   
pose them. But their admiration for his courage in protecting them   
was offset by their gradual realization that he seemed to make little   
effort to avoid difficulties with the authorities, and even appeared   
to court them. He derived a certain amount of pleasure from his   
own humiliation; or, as one of his European cellmates explained,   
"He asked for trouble, got beatings, and was then satisfied." Ben6t   
also had a penchant for bringing up highly controversial subjects   
when he need not have done so — for instance, the possible recon-   
ciliation of Catholicism with Communist materialism. He enjoyed   
these flirtations with danger and the opportunities they afforded   
for displaying his intellectual brilliance and his extensive knowl-   
edge of Communist theory — a practice they called "skating on thin   
ice."   
  
An even more serious problem was his tendency to be domineer-   
ing, and he was frequently told by his Western cellmates that he   
would have made a "good Prussian corporal." What particularly   
disturbed them was the vehemence with which he denounced fel-   
low-prisoners:   
  
He fell too easily into beating on one . . . making a man afraid . . .   
scolding him for hours ... if he won't come out with something . . .   

----------------------- Page 144-----------------------

forcing him to dig deeper ... he rather enjoyed doing such things.   
  
l62 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
After being pressured from above, he invariably increased his   
demands upon the other Europeans; wary of his approach, they   
frequently offered resistance, but they could not avoid completely   
the effects of his powerful influence.   
  
Gradually the group moved in a "progressive" direction. Under   
Benet's direction, it studied Communist theory and practice, legal   
codes and policy documents, and particularly case histories — of   
"big criminals" who had been successfully re-educated, treated   
leniently, and accepted into Communist society, and of lesser of-   
fenders whose unwillingness to confess and reform resulted in their   
being shot. In his zeal, Benet was far from precise in his transla-   
tions, and frequently slanted them in the direction of his own   
point of view: "Sometimes he did not translate at all, but just told   
us what he wanted us to hear." The net result was a feeling, on   
the part of both the officials and the prisoners themselves, that the   
Westerners had "raised" their (Communist-style) "political level."   
  
But such "progress" had to be at the expense of group solidarity.   
No longer pulling together in a protective effort, the Westerners'   
potential sources of friction became open antagonisms. Differences   
of opinion about how to behave were inextricably merged with the   
irritations of close confinement, as each of the men experienced his   
own special set of resentments.   
  
Kallmann (the "typical German") describes this from his own   
experience:   
  
Lots of antagonism developed between us. I myself suffered particularly.   
I developed a hatred at times against more or less all of them . . . hun-   
dreds of minor ridiculous things.   
  
Kallmann sometimes viewed these differences as petty irritations,   
such as his impatience with Weber's voice ("loud and like a trum-   
pet"). At other times he interpreted them through the idiom of the   
environment, seeing in Bauer's egotism "a typical example of an   
imperialist." He could, however, recognize that much of the trouble   
came from within himself: "I developed a horrible psychosis. . . .   
I knew my irritabilities were particularly great."   
  
Emile (the scientist-priest) and Weber (the businessman-ad-   
venturer), were still close to each other, and had a common prob-   
lem. Neither of them as intellectually quick as the others, both   
of them stubborn, they were frequently made the "scapegoats" (so-   
  
  
GROUP REFORM   
  

----------------------- Page 145-----------------------

called by themselves and the others) of the group controversies.   
Emile (his humor and goodwill notwithstanding) was resented   
for his unwillingness to compromise when the group thought it   
necessary. Weber's position was much more painful. Impetuous and   
outspoken, he had immense difficulty in adjusting to group dis-   
cipline, both to the general prison discipline and to the particular   
discipline imposed by the other Westerners. He was frequently   
guilty of such offenses as breaking dishes (a very serious matter),   
for which he was severely criticized by both the Chinese and West-   
erners.   
  
More important, Weber insisted upon maintaining a separate,   
personal approach, an attitude of "absolute sincerity"; he deeply   
resented attempts by anyone to "force me to act differently from   
what I felt." He neither accepted nor fully understood the tactics   
used by the other Westerners. They in turn criticized him sharply,   
feeling this criticism to be necessary from the standpoint of group   
survival. But he remained convinced that the others were picking   
on him in order to rid themselves of their own tensions.   
  
Weber also was the center of an especially bizarre and disturb-   
ing situation. The group of foreigners was required to denounce the   
wife of one of its members, who was being held in the woman's sec-   
tion of the same prison. The denunciation became a very important   
issue, because refusal to participate meant questioning the infal-   
libility of the government. Each of the other foreigners, including   
the husband, denounced her as a tactical maneuver — but Weber   
refused to do so, despite the insistence of the husband himself. In   
this matter Weber's attitude elicited respect and caused the others   
shame as well as anger.   
  
Even when the group was functioning smoothly, Weber felt   
uncomfortable with its policies; but during the turmoil of BeneYs   
leadership, the pressures became so unbearable to him that he   
longed to be transferred to another cell — the only member of the   
group who at any time preferred to be separated from it prior to   
release.   
  
My mental suffering was the limit of what I could endure ... my   
main suffering came from these foreigners . . . not so much with the   
inspectors who I felt tried to be human. . . . Whatever I did I was   
always in the wrong. ... I felt like a kind of prey in a cage. ... I   
often thought it would be a pleasure to be transferred and to get away   
from this mental pressure. ... I couldn't trust my friends or myself!   
  
164 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
No one escaped experiencing hostility toward each of the others,   
nor did anyone fully avoid becoming the target of the others'   
resentment. Now it was Bauer's aggressive and superior manner,   
now Kallmann's intransigent "progressivism," now Weber's shift   
from Kallmann to Bauer for guidance and support — and all these   

----------------------- Page 146-----------------------

seemed most disrupting during this chaotic time.   
  
But the central focus of group dissension was Ben6t himself.   
Here everyone had strong feelings, since Benet's character and   
policies so forcibly affected the minute-to-minute existence of each.   
The sentiment was mainly negative; most of the other Westerners   
were highly resentful of his egotism, his instability, and his extreme   
behavior. They were by no means united, however, in their attitudes   
toward him. Countering their resentment was their awareness of   
his courage in shielding them. Kallmann was the group member   
who felt this most keenly, and was for some time Benet's closest   
collaborator and most staunch defender. His affection for him had   
begun when the two men had been together in a different cell be-   
fore the formation of the Western group. At that time, when Kall-   
mann was near-psychotic and overwhelmed by fear after his un-   
successful attempt at suicide, Benet had been compassionate, pa-   
tient, and very helpful in teaching him how to deal with the officials.   
Kallmann had become convinced of the validity of Benet's ap-   
proach, and believed it to be based on a superior understanding of   
Communism. Moreover, Kallmann's strong fears led him to the   
conviction that "we must work their mentalities into ourselves and   
really feel the guilt" — because "only when I get to the stage where   
I can genuinely feel the guilt can I genuinely convince them."   
  
For a long time he felt only gratitude toward Benet:   
  
For the first months they could only approach us through him, and   
he took all of the struggles. If he criticized us, we beat him back. He   
was like a cushion, pressed from both sides. ... I cautioned the others   
that this was a great strain for him. He was the person who best served   
as a teacher in how to behave with the Communists ... he shielded   
us ... he was kind-hearted, and we took advantage of it. . . . He   
did as much for us as any comrade could do.   
  
But after a few more months, even Kallmann resisted Benet's   
"exaggerations," and criticized much of his domineering and ag-   
gressive behavior. The others in the group were less impressed by   
  
GROUP REFORM l6j   
  
BeneYs shielding of them, and more consistent in their resentment.   
Bauer especially was constantly antagonistic to Benet ("When I   
look at you, I realize why Martin Luther reformed the Catholic   
Church"), strongly opposed his policies, and attempted to offset   
his influence in the group whenever possible. Emile was in conflict   
with him over statements and attitudes about the Catholic Church,   
and on several occasions flew into a rage because of BeneYs be-   
havior. To Weber, Benet was a "proper charlatan."   
  
The result of this conflict was an intragroup struggle for power   
and influence, something like the Communist intraparty struggle,   
rather than a harmonious, mutually-nourishing interplay. To be sure,   

----------------------- Page 147-----------------------

even during this period the Europeans made strong attempts to   
preserve some degree of unity. Kallmann, for instance, recognizing   
his growing hostilities, pleaded with the group for assistance, and   
got some, at least temporarily.   
  
I confessed it to my comrades and asked them to help me out of it —   
not to allow me to isolate myself . . . and they helped me. . . . Our   
antagonisms were not easy to overcome.   
  
But the trend was one of disruption. As confusion between, as   
one man expressed it, "playing the game and reality" mounted,   
the protection of a united group was lost.   
  
What was behind Father Benet's rather strange approach, and   
where did it lead? This was not the first group with which he had   
come in conflict. The statements of others who knew him well   
— both in and out of prison — (and I have to rely on these, since   
he was the only one of this six-man group I did not have the op-   
portunity to interview) indicate he had always been a man of   
great learning, erratic behavior, and seething inner rebellion. Col-   
leagues who worked with him described him as an opinionated,   
outspoken person, perpetually involved in disputes. He was always   
very sensitive to criticism from others, and one friend felt that he   
had a "weak paranoia." Despite this, he had had a brilliant and   
vigorous career as a Jesuit missionary in China.   
  
Originally torn between the French and German cultural in-   
fluences present in the border area in which he grew up, he found   
a new cultural home in China: he participated energetically in   
Chinese life, he learned a great deal about the civilization, and   
translated many religious works into Chinese. His identification   
  
l66 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
with his mission-land was so strong that he had, during the course   
of his work, taken out Chinese citizenship; a tradition had been   
established for this by earlier missionaries, but it was nonetheless a   
highly unusual step. Later, under the Communists, he had favored   
the acceptance of the government-sponsored independent church   
movement, and refrained from joining it only because of orders   
from his religious superiors.   
  
His colleagues believed that much of his behavior in prison   
was influenced by his overwhelming desire to remain in China as   
a missionary. They also cited as another very important influence   
something that had happened shortly before Benet was arrested.   
Two Chinese brothers whom Benet knew well were imprisoned   
by the Communists: one of them "confessed" and was released;   
the other refused to confess and was shot. This was believed to   
be crucial in his later conviction that "confession is the only way   
out." In addition, he had, early in his own imprisonment, experi-   
enced what a colleague referred to as "a near-complete breakdown";   

----------------------- Page 148-----------------------

and one of his Western cellmates attributed his later behavior to   
"enormous fear." He also developed the concept that it was neces-   
sary to degrade oneself "to convince the Communists that you are   
with them — and not in grace in the bourgeois world — so that   
the Communists would feel that you were so degraded in the   
bourgeois world that you could not go back."   
  
Even in prison he had moments which paralleled the brilliance   
of his missionary career, and evoked admiration from his Western   
cellmates. "He was so sparkling. ... he had a strongly French   
personality — flexible, elastic, extremely 'intellectual' in a formal   
way . . . like Voltaire." And there was a certain amount of awe   
even in their criticisms of him. "He had a satanic, biting humor . . .   
with his sharp intellect he could criticize everyone, even God." But   
his prestige and his power within the group soon declined. His   
penchant for, even joy in, self-humiliation caused the other West-   
erners to lose respect for him. Further, his extremism led to dis-   
trust, both among Westerners and Chinese. It was felt that he was   
"too convincing" — or, in other words, easily seen through as in-   
sincere. Other Westerners referred to him as "the foxy philos-   
opher"; Chinese prisoners called him "the fox." Although he was   
technically their study leader for more than a year, his influence   
on the Europeans gradually waned during the last half of this   
  
GROUP REFORM l6j   
  
period, and by mutual unspoken consent Benet began to study   
more and more with the Chinese prisoners. When he was transferred   
from the cell, after fifteen months with the European group, he   
was an isolated, bitter, and defeated man:   
  
At the end he didn't want to be with our group, only wanted to study   
with the Chinese, and went one hundred per cent the Chinese way.   
. . . When he left he was down and out, fed up with everything, and   
especially with us — because we wouldn't follow him.   
  
Phase of Adaptation   
  
Father Vechten, the Dutch priest who was the last of the six   
to join the group, entered the cell while Ben6t was still in charge.   
Since he too could speak, read, and write Chinese, the other Euro-   
peans began to turn to him as an intermediary between themselves   
and the officials or their Chinese cellmates. Father Vechten, both   
in his translations, and in his general approach, was a much more   
moderate and reliable guide than Benet. Their willingness to be in-   
fluenced by him undoubtedly was an important factor in the au-   
thorities' later decision to make him the official "study leader."   
  
But even before this, other changes from above helped to create   
an atmosphere in which he could assume informal leadership. Al-   
though pressures were still very strong, the extreme struggle atmos-   
phere which had prevailed during Ben6t's first few months in the   

----------------------- Page 149-----------------------

cell had gone. The acute assaults required to "raise" the group's   
political level had given way to longer-term demands for the con-   
solidation of what had been accomplished, and the grinding out of   
further, day-to-day "progress." The vindictive cell chief was replaced   
by a conscientious but somewhat less zealous person. And during   
this period, also, the group benefited from the generally moderating   
effects of the policy change in the Chinese penal system already   
referred to in Chapter 4. The extreme exhortation, the one-sided   
atmosphere, the hysteria of the mass campaigns, the unrelenting   
criticism were all still very much there. But the Westerners were   
permitted to settle in, and to experience their reform as a more   
evolutionary, and less explosive procedure.   
  
What influence did Father Vechten have on the Western group?   
His personal qualities were in many ways the direct antitheses of   
those of the man he replaced: a steady intelligence without bril-   
  
l68 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
liance, a circumspect and cautious approach, a capacity to instill   
profound trust in others. Further, he set a high example of personal   
courage and self-sacrifice, and always backed up his professed prin-   
ciples with his personal actions.   
  
Before he could begin to make his influence felt, however, he   
had to be personally broken in, initiated into the group pattern   
through the "raising" of his own personal level of reform to that   
of the others. (Although he had been through rather severe con-   
fession pressures during his previous months of imprisonment, he   
had not yet experienced a sustained re-education program.) Dur-   
ing his first few weeks in the cell, therefore, he was severely strug-   
gled, largely about issues dealing with the relationship of church   
activities to "imperialism."   
  
Nor was his first response to the group completely auspicious.   
At one point, when he was being treated in a way he considered   
extremely unjust, he burst into tears in a manner described by a   
cellmate as "crying with fury." He had already won the sympathy   
of the other Westerners, but they were "surprised and shocked" at   
his lack of control. He weathered this episode, greatly helped by   
the other Europeans; at the same time they persuaded him that he   
had to make some concessions in order to get along.   
  
For a while he was quite uncomfortable about making these   
concessions, and disturbed by the confusion in the group under   
Benet's leadership. But once he became convinced that the other   
Westerners genuinely wished to assist him, and that there was a   
possibility of a co-operative group approach, he became increasingly   
willing to compromise and fall into step. Interestingly enough,   
it was Bauer's "good fellowship" — despite definite points of con-   
flict between the two men — which did most to persuade Vechten.   
Once he had achieved some harmony with the group, Vechten's   

----------------------- Page 150-----------------------

authority was quickly established.   
  
For a brief period, there was a certain amount of infighting among   
the Westerners, a conflict among them over policy, and an inner   
struggle for control of the group. Bauer and Kallmann were re-   
sisting Benet's authority, which was declining; Vechten agreed more   
with them than with Benet, and his own leadership developed aided   
by their support.   
  
Out of the confusion came a definite group policy which replaced   
chaos with a fair measure of stability. The approach was not com-   
  
GROUP REFORM 169   
  
pletely new, nor the exclusive idea of any one man; but it was   
Vechten, strongly influenced by Bauer, who did more than any-   
one else to develop it> The policy consisted of a form of acting   
— or "window dressing" — in which the Westerners made "big self-   
accusations backed up by small facts": one would accuse himself,   
for instance, of being "reactionary" and "backward," because of   
taking too much time in going to the bathroom.   
  
Even more important, this tactic involved continual emphasis   
upon "playing the game" rather than losing oneself completely in   
the reform process. Vechten, for example, might criticize another   
Westerner harshly, but at the same time he would attempt to get   
across to him some indication that he was merely going through   
the necessary motions. This could not usually be done overtly,   
but semantic tricks were exploited by the Westerners to create a   
communication system which their Chinese cellmates could not   
penetrate. They sometimes spoke in French or German; when   
this was prohibited, they interjected single words or concepts   
from European languages. They also developed special pronuncia-   
tions to which they ascribed their own connotations. For instance,   
they distinguished between people in the ordinary meaning and   
the Communist mystique of "the people," by using an ordinary   
English pronunciation for the first meaning, and a mock French   
pronunciation — pee-pul — for the second. Similarly, "horse language"   
became a euphemism for German, and when Vechten would ad-   
vise some of the others not to use the "horse language," they would   
know that he meant it "as a friend and not really from the side   
of the government." Vechten maintained at all times the convic-   
tion that "you must conserve your higher values in confession. . . .   
not let them bring you down."   
  
This new approach was essentially a compromise between the two   
earlier ones. In its stress upon preservation of individual dignity, it   
resembled Bauer's method during phase one; but it entailed much   
more concession to and individual participation in the reform pro-   
gram. In its insistence upon a strongly "progressive" display, it   
resembled Benet's approach of phase two; but its crucial difference   
was the distinction it made between public gestures made to placate   

----------------------- Page 151-----------------------

the government and the private world of resistance maintained   
among the Europeans.   
  
The policy was logical enough. The difficulty lay in carrying it   
  
I7O THOUGHT REFORM   
  
out. The group not only had to satisfy Chinese officials and cell-   
mates, it also had to sustain courage and cohesion among the group   
members. And it was here that Vechten's special genius emerged.   
He demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to deflate hostilities,   
dissolve conflicts, and preserve group unity. He invariably accom-   
plished this through a human appeal to the contending or dis-   
ruptive parties, and always sought to mediate and Snd something   
which he could personally share with each of them. Even his re-   
placement of Benet as the actual leader of the group was accom-   
plished with surprisingly little hostility. He approached Benet sym-   
pathetically, and made an effort to avoid animosity despite their   
differences of policy; and at the same time he adopted, as a per-   
sonal principle, Benet's concept that it was the duty of a Catholic   
priest to assist others in so stressful a situation. To the other West-   
erners, he emphasized Benet's personal sacrifices, and defended   
him in the face of their sharp criticisms. When Benet finally left   
the group, Vechten was on closer terms with him than was any   
other Westerner.   
  
In a similar fashion, when Bauer's Nazi and racist views led to   
friction — Vechten himself had strong inner resentments on this   
matter since he had lived through the Nazi occupation of Holland,   
and also identified closely with the Chinese people — he appealed   
to Bauer's "corps spirit"; he would mention their personal bond —   
Bauer's mother came from an area close to Vechten's birthplace.   
In the continuous conflict between Weber and the others in the   
group, he was a continuous mediator. He sympathized with Weber   
because of common features in their background, and because both   
had "rough and good-hearted" characters. He viewed Weber as a   
man who, because of personal limitations, particularly needed help   
to get through the experience; and he emphasized this need to the   
others while at the same time using his influence with Weber to   
get him to submit to group discipline. With Kallmann, he found   
common ground in their religious feelings, despite the fact that   
Kallmann was a Protestant; he also discussed with him what was   
closest to Kallmann's heart — his wife and family. This sympathy   
helped Kallmann overcome many of his antagonisms, and also   
served to dispel occasional differences which arose between Kall-   
mann and Vechten himself over policy and leadership. When   
Emile came into conflict with the group because of his intransigence,   
  
GROUP REFORM 171   
  
Vechten appealed to him as a fellow priest, emphasizing the good   
he could do for others by co-operating.   

----------------------- Page 152-----------------------

  
Vechten's path was not always smooth, however, and he ex-   
perienced his own personal difficulties. When he was caught be-   
tween strong pressures from above, and resistance to his policies   
from below, he would sometimes have outbursts of anger, severe   
headaches, or tremors. He had moments when he felt that the   
game he was leading, with its concessions to the Communists, was   
"dirty," and from the standpoint of a priest, wrong. Therefore,   
when another European would resist his demands with the accus-   
ing statement, "And you a priest—" he became extremely upset.   
He was also tortured by the feeling that the others in the group   
did not really like him or fully trust him. But he did not allow these   
disruptive emotions to persist, and if he could not overcome them   
himself, he accepted the help of others in the group. Bauer knew   
best how to render personal assistance to Vechten — reassuring him   
of the admiration the others had for him, and gently warning him   
on one occasion that he was becoming too angry in his dealings   
with the others and that the sides of his mouth were beginning to   
turn downward. Bauer also took advantage of his medical standing   
to do something else for Vechten: he told an official that Vechten's   
headaches, if not checked, could develop into a mental breakdown,   
hoping thereby to ease the pressures on him and to speed up his   
release. Kallmann by this time was over his own crisis, and he be-   
came strong enough to lend moral support to Vechten and to the   
others. All saw Vechten's difficulties as understandable sensitivities   
for which he deserved their help. Everyone had become, to some   
extent, a therapist for everyone else.   
  
In this way the group gradually evolved enough of an equilib-   
rium among its individual members to function as an effective unit.   
It was a tenuous equilibrium which could be readily threatened;   
but a certain balance prevailed. Although no individual member   
was immune to attack, the group as a whole offered protection,   
solace, and amelioration. It prevented Bauer from being too bold,   
Kallmann from being too submissive, Vechten from demanding   
too many concessions. It listened to and prescribed for emotional   
problems from any source. When the balance seemed to be giving   
way in the face of internal conflicts, the group invariably found   
itself reunited by the immediate threat of new assaults from with-   
  
172 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
out. At the same time, the group was ever mindful of the danger   
that their inner dissension, if not checked, might be exploited by   
Chinese cellmates or by prison officials.   
  
The group pattern and the double life of its members thus be-   
came a means of resistance. The group had reached its highest   
point of re-education under Benet, and this reform trend continued   
to some extent during the early months of Vechten's leadership;   
but after this, the equilibrium worked toward fending off — although   
by no means completely escaping — Communist influence.   

----------------------- Page 153-----------------------

  
An important aspect of the equilibrium was the relationship of   
the group to the Chinese prisoners who lived in the same cell. Here   
Vechten's influence was particularly important, as his affection for   
Chinese culture and Chinese people became quickly apparent. He   
was the most popular of the Westerners among the Chinese, and   
his personal integrity made a strong impression upon them. This   
compatibility was more than just a convenience; it played an ex-   
tremely important part in the group's survival. Chinese prisoners   
tended to become (or at least appeared to become) more quickly   
and enthusiastically "progressive" than Westerners, and they were   
likely to express strong political and personal animosities toward   
Westerners. Much of this hostile feeling had prevailed with this   
group of Europeans, particularly during Ben&'s leadership. But   
Vechten's personal appeal, as well as the improved atmosphere   
within the Western group, brought about a gradual change in the   
situation; antagonism from Chinese cellmates gave way to a tol-   
erant, sometimes even friendly, attitude. The Chinese were ap-   
parently impressed by much of the Westerners' behavior, and   
sometimes seemed to be attempting to imitate it themselves. Peri-   
odically, they still loosed torrents of criticism upon their European   
cellmates, but these were not necessarily hateful in tone, and they   
had a lot of performance in them. Even Bauer's attitude of su-   
periority (which they were aware of, and which he frequently had   
to confess to) was absorbed. Later on, during the recreation periods   
afforded by more "lenient treatment," the Europeans found them-   
selves teaching their Chinese cellmates various games, and even   
social dancing. The Western group had, so to speak, secured its   
flank; every bit of goodwill from its Chinese cellmates created   
some measure of insulation from reform pressures.   
  
The qualities in Vechten which meant so much to this group   
  
GROUP REFORM 173   
  
were not emerging for the first time. As a missionary, he had shown   
unusual ability and leadership. His special talents for bringing   
men together, for arbitrating between extremes, for pursuing a   
steady and moderate approach, had long been prominent. Yet   
it is interesting to note that from early life he had been subject   
to severe episodes of uncontrolled anger. As a child he experienced   
such severe temper tantrums when his will was frustrated that "I   
would turn red, then blue, and stop breathing, and my brother   
had to beat me to make me again conscious"; during early ado-   
lescence he suffered from almost daily headaches, caused mainly by   
inner hostility; as a young man he had outbursts of anger or tears.   
He had painfully conquered these tendencies, largely through his   
strong emotional bonds with the Catholic religion; and his skills   
as a moderator were in part the reflection of his highly-developed   
personal mechanisms of control. They were much more than this,   
however, because they depended upon an additional quality which   
was described by Bauer as "echt," a term by which he suggested   

----------------------- Page 154-----------------------

purity and authenticity: "He is not an imitation. He doesn't pre-   
tend to be what he is not ... he is one of the few people I have   
met in life who at least realizes what he is." What Bauer meant by   
this statement was Vechten's unusual integrity, his ability to live   
the life to which he claimed to aspire. At moments when Vechten   
felt himself overwhelmed by anger, guilt, and doubt, he would   
draw upon an unusual blend of the supernatural and the human:   
"Praying brings you back to the reality of what you are. Talking   
with the group of foreigners [Europeans], had a similar effect."   
  
The full impact of Vechten's prison behavior can only be under-   
stood through the effect it had on his Western cellmates. His leader-   
ship, once assumed, was never questioned; his influence increased   
steadily over the two years he was in the cell, until the eventual   
breakup of the group through the sentencing and release of the   
Western prisoners. He was the only person among the Europeans   
whose stature completely overshadowed the complicated hostilities   
and weaknesses which thought reform engenders — the one most   
warmly and unreservedly praised by all of the others. Every one of   
them felt that it was his influence, more than anything else, that   
kept the group intact, which in turn preserved the values and   
stability of each of them. Kallmann perhaps summed up their   
feelings best:   
  
174 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
He made the most impressive showing of all of us — human and spirit-   
ual. He never really lowered himself ... he taught us how to do the   
necessary and still keep our own.   
  
Epilogue   
  
To what extent was the group successful? Did it really protect   
the psychological health and the private beliefs of its members?   
We can answer this by taking a brief look at each of the men im-   
mediately after his release.   
  
The first of the six to arrive in Hong Kong was Father Bendt.   
I was not able to interview him (either because of his resistance,   
or that of his Church colleagues, or both), but I was able to talk   
with several people very close to him. Ben£t claimed that his rel-   
atively early release proved that his policy had been the best one   
after all; but there was much question about this, since he was re-   
leased simultaneously with a number of other French priests, ap-   
parently for political reasons. He had spent almost another year   
in a different cell after his transfer from the group. At some point,   
his attitude (or at least his tactics) dramatically changed: not only   
did he become a good deal less "progressive" himself, but he en-   
couraged resistance in others; and a Westerner who had known him   
in both cells described him as "completely different." When he ar-   
rived in Hong Kong, his old friends felt that his prison experience   
had left him "not much changed" — still brilliantly outspoken and   

----------------------- Page 155-----------------------

erratic as ever. They were struck, however, by his combination   
of bitter criticism of the Communists and his impression of their   
immense power, their near-invincibility. Unusually fearful during   
the post-release period, Benet had apparently undergone a great   
emotional upset rather than an ideological change. His form of   
totalism had carried him from his initial stance of the apparent   
convert to the opposite (and clearly related) category of the ap-   
parent resister. Yet like Bishop Barker and others in this latter   
category, his sharp condemnation of Communism was in part a   
defensive device for denying the profound reform influences he had   
clearly absorbed. I will say more about his peculiar form of leader-   
ship later on.   
  
Dr. Bauer was the next to arrive; and since he had been con-   
sidered the most reactionary, his belief that the date of a prisoner's   
  
GROUP REFORM I75   
  
telease had little to do with the extent of his "progress" was con-   
firmed. He was, as might be expected, the most adamant in his   
denunciation of the Communists, and the most personally removed   
from the Communist communication system. Although not with-   
out fear, he was very quick to regain sufficient composure and de-   
tachment to launch into a comprehensive analysis of Communist   
methods. More than any of the others, he emphasized the absolute   
effectiveness of the group — even to the point of idealization: "We   
played theatre with them day in and day out." When discussing   
the other group members, he spoke in a similar vein, stressing the   
"comradeship" of each, and carefully controlling his own hostilities   
wherever they existed — except in the case of his feelings toward   
Benet, which were admittedly bitter. He was an archetype of the   
apparent resister, and he exhibited clearly the oppositional atti-   
tudes, the totalism in his character, and the use of repression and   
denial to ward off reform influences. Yet he did impress me as be-   
ing one of the least affected ideologically of all of my Western sub-   
jects. He had tenaciously held on to his alternative Nazi ideology    
(although disclaiming of course its excesses); but he emphasized   
even more his frank devotion to "bourgeois" family life, and always   
maintained a controlled charm and friendliness with me and with   
whomever he met in Hong Kong. His identity had stood firm.   
  
Father Emile, whom I met next, was somewhat confused and   
agitated when he arrived, but he still managed to express himself   
with a good deal of gaiety and humor, as he had when in prison.   
He was critical of the Communists, but less interested in discussing   
ideological matters than in the sequence of his own experiences   
and their religious implications; he frequently mentioned St. Paul.   
He referred to the group sympathetically ("Foreigners tried to pro-   
tect each other") but did not speak of it with especially strong   
emotion. He had spent just one year in the group, less time than   
most of the others, and had for the last few months of his im-   
prisonment been permitted to perform technical work under much   

----------------------- Page 156-----------------------

less intensive psychological pressure. His colleagues felt that he   
had greatly matured through his prison experience, that he had   
attained more self-mastery, and greater inner peace, and that he   
was not as "overly active" as they felt he had been before.   
  
Mr. Kallmann emerged with a strong need to discuss his experi-   
ences in great detail as a means of conquering his remaining fear.   
  
176 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
Sensitive to psychological currents, he spoke with a striking combina-   
tion of insight and confusion. He stated that he had "studied hard,"   
learned a great deal, and now wished to "continue his studies"   
through extensive readings in non-Communist political literature;   
he felt that he could never become an adherent of the Communist   
world, but had come to realize the grave shortcomings of the   
capitalist world. He spoke enthusiastically of his experiences in the   
group: "They were all marvelous comrades . . . we always felt we   
were mentally holding our own," although he also talked of the dif-   
ficulties and the painful personal irritabilities. He remained Benet's   
staunchest defender. While he was certainly among the obviously   
confused, he believed that he had been protected from Communist   
indoctrination by the values he had absorbed from the German   
youth movement: "Erlebnis . . . the value in life of the natural   
experience . . . the sensation of the eternal beauty of what God   
creates." It was to this earlier ideology that he wished to return.   
  
Mr. Weber too had signs of obvious confusion when I met   
him in Hong Kong. He felt that his condition had been greatly   
improved by a period of skilled manual labor in which he had par-   
ticipated after his transfer from the group. Vehemently critical of   
the Communists, he nonetheless had become convinced during   
his imprisonment that "evolutionary socialism rather than revolu-   
tion" was desirable; and he also felt that the technique of self-   
criticism could be a useful personal device. Concerning the group   
and its function, he was more critical than any of the others, and   
emphasized the suffering it caused him and his relief at being   
separated from it. Yet in the next breath, he would unwittingly   
praise it, pointing out that "we foreigners used self-criticism in   
a fair way," in contrast to the cruel and "reckless manner of the   
Communists." Moreover, the behavior of Emile and Vechten had   
so deeply impressed him that he wished to return to his own active   
Catholic religious practice. He managed his mixed feelings about the   
group with outward good humor: "I guess we were all a bit crazy   
in there." On the whole, he wanted to leave his prison experience   
behind him and be "through with politics."   
  
Father Vechten, even after his arrival in Hong Kong, remained   
the group's leader and guardian. Still speaking as if responsible   
for it, he gave the most thoughtful and comprehensive picture of   
its function. He was in fact remarkably balanced in all of his ex-   
  

----------------------- Page 157-----------------------

GROUP REFORM I77   
  
pressed opinions, and yet he too spoke of feeling confused about   
many issues. Rather than seeing himself as the hero which the others   
thought him to be, he was deeply troubled that "maybe I was   
too progressive." He seemed mildly depressed, torn by feelings   
of shame and guilt; and he minimized his own accomplishments   
at every turn. He did feel that the "corps spirit" of the group had   
been very helpful to everyone, including himself, and he recognized   
that he had been "better than the others" in holding the group   
together; but he also stated that "all of us could have very easily   
been enemies. . . . except for the fact that we all had a greater   
enemy." Deeply aware of the magnitude of individual antagonisms,   
he tended, if anything, to understate the group's accomplishments.   
He was critical of Communist theory and practice, and much con-   
cerned (like Father Luca) about the future of the Catholic Church   
in China. He felt that he had done his Church a great disservice in   
making certain confessions about religion. After a few weeks in   
Hong Kong, his psychological state seemed a bit improved, but   
he still stressed that he had much to think about in the future.   
  
In assessing these men after their release, it was not easy to make   
an over-all judgment of the group's effectiveness. One thing is   
immediately clear: the experience meant something different to   
each of its members. For Bauer, the experience was a panacea, al-   
though his reaction must be judged in the light of a tendency to   
idealize many of his relationships as a way to control disruptive   
forces within himself; for Weber it was painful and humiliating, and   
yet even he derived emotional benefits from it; for Ben6t, the group   
exposure must have been deeply disillusioning; and for the re-   
maining three men, it was, to varying degrees, a source of strength,   
despite its emotional pitfalls. Moreover, the man whom the others   
saw as the unifying spirit (Vechten) seemed much less enthusiastic   
about the group's effectiveness than at least two of the others (Bauer   
and Kallmann); and many of the very acts of leadership which the   
others thought heroic were to him shameful evidences of compro-   
mise.   
  
I felt, when I interviewed these men in Hong Kong, that the   
group achievement had been a rather remarkable one. These six   
men had succeeded in creating a small world of partial independence   
within the larger threatening universe of the Communist prison.   
Their independence was never anything like complete, and at   
  
170 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
times it seemed about to disappear altogether; but its survival created   
vital alternatives within an otherwise saturated environment. The   
intellectual alternative — the standing critique of Communist theory   
— was impressive enough; but even more important was the emo-   
tional alternative — the construction through trust and co-operative   
resistance of a psychological "home" and "family" where each mem-   

----------------------- Page 158-----------------------

ber could find support and spiritual replenishment, and thereby   
avoid complete dependence upon the offerings of reform. This   
amounted to the undermining of thought reform's communica-   
tion network, an impediment to the milieu control which thought   
reform seeks always to maintain. These six men were not reformed   
within a closed system of Communist discourse: rather, by pool-   
ing their knowledge and the emotions of their individual back-   
grounds, they created a vital alternative to the Communist system.   
In the midst of penal thought reform pressures this was no mean   
accomplishment.   
  
There is little doubt that the group did much to preserve the   
emotional well-being and the resistance to Communist influence of   
its individual members. It also, of course, to some extent served as   
a vehicle for conveying Communist influence to those within it;   
but it is probably fair to say that, without the group, this influence   
would have been at least as great and a good deal more painful.   
  
The results of this group achievement were evident in the condi-   
tion of the five men I interviewed after release.They showed symp-   
toms and attitudes in many ways typical of all of my subjects, but   
they were quicker than others to overcome confusion and fear and   
to begin to reconstruct a sense of identity in the non-Communist   
environment. As far as indoctrination was concerned, I felt that   
these men had emerged slightly less affected than my average sub-   
ject. Their distribu tion among the response categories was not un-   
usual (four obviously confused, one apparent resister, and one ap-   
parent convert turned apparent resister); but they were unusual in   
their capacities to weigh their reform experience not only against   
what they found in the non-Communist world, but also against   
the alternative group ethos they had known during their imprison-   
ment.   
  
These judgments were, of course, tenuous. So many factors af-   
fected the way in which a man emerged that it was very difficult,   
in comparing these people with other subjects, to evaluate the   
  
GROUP REFORM I79   
  
part which the group had played. And I had to keep in mind the   
fact that this group contained two men who had made serious   
suicidal attempts, the only ones among my twenty-five subjects.   
Indeed, in the followup studies I made three years later (see Chap-   
ter 10), I encountered a number of surprises, including severe   
emotional difficulties which I had not been able to predict. I con-   
cluded then that the group had supplied a good deal of spiritual   
nourishment and protection during the imprisonment itself, but   
that this protection could not last sufficiently to avoid profound   
problems later on. Nonetheless, the psychological and biological   
strengths which an intimate group structure can evoke were con-   
vincingly demonstrated.   
  

----------------------- Page 159-----------------------

Styles of Leadership   
  
What did the history of this group reveal about the relationship   
among leader, milieu demands, and group behavior? The exag-   
gerated and bizarre quality of the group experience throws into   
sharp relief principles which are equally operative, if less apparent,   
in everyday situations.   
  
Three men became official or unofficial leaders of this group of   
Westerners during the course of its existence, and yet none was   
the leader during his entire stay with the group. Each of the three   
men developed a style of leadership which became characteristic   
for the particular phase which he dominated. What characterized   
each style, and what produced it?   
  
The first, Bauer's hegemony during the academic phase, was   
characterized by intellectual leadership and avoidance of participa-   
tion. The combination which produced this style was: first, a lax   
milieu, which said, in effect, as long as you keep studying and seem   
to be reforming, you will not be bothered; second, a previously de-   
moralized group of three Westerners ready to respond to any show   
of strength; and third, the sudden appearance of a confident and   
emotionally intact European (Bauer) psychologically suited to   
exert strong influence over others. Bauer's intellectual skills were   
especially useful at a time when independent study and speculation   
were allowed; his authoritarian emotional traits served well during   
a period when maximum self-assertion and resistance were per-   
mitted; his human skills (which were considerable) were especially   
  
l8o THOUGHT REFORM   
  
geared to foster individual strength rather than a spirit of compromise   
in others, which is just what is needed when resistance is possible.   
  
The style of academic resistance which developed had something   
to offer to everyone: to the officials and the cell chief directing the   
outer environment, a studious display and a certain amount of re-   
form; to the other Westerners, protection, clear policy, and spell-   
binding intellectual excursions; to Bauer himself, a means of re-   
maining emotionally intact and avoiding anxiety by guiding and   
dominating others, as well as egocentric satisfactions derived by   
the exercise of his superior intellect. This style of leadership was   
thus nourishing to all of the Westerners, although perhaps most so   
to Bauer himself; others in the group (especially Kallmann and   
Weber) had more of a need to submit, and indeed were sometimes   
.at odds with Bauer even during this harmonious time. From the   
standpoint of group independence, this was the most successful of   
the three styles of leadership. It was also the easiest of the three to   
maintain.   
  
The second style (BeneYs) involved histrionic exhortation and   
the splitting of identity. The circumstances were very different: the   

----------------------- Page 160-----------------------

group had not chosen an unofficial leader, but rather had had an   
official one thrust upon it. And the style of leadership, although   
predominant, was never fully accepted by the other group members.   
In terms of the three factors we have been discussing: the environ-   
ment had suddenly clamped down — no more of this foolery, we   
mean business, and you had better reform yourselves or else; the   
four Westerners, who by this time had learned the ropes, were   
ready to make concessions where necessary, but were still riding a   
small private wave of resistance; and a newcomer, Ben6t, appeared   
who was a strange blend of fear, brilliance, exhibitionism, and   
sadomasochism. Benet behaved as he did partly because he be-   
lieved that extreme progressivism was necessary, and partly because   
he was so frightened — primarily because the combination of self-   
flagellating submissiveness and arrogant, pain-inflicting domination   
of others was his own long-standing mechanism for dealing with   
anxiety. Yet this mechanism was especially appropriate for the   
position into which Ben£t was thrust: any new study leader under   
these same circumstances would have had to take a good deal of   
punishment from the officials and cell chief above, and deal in   
some mutually painful manner with the recalcitrant Westerners   
  
GROUP REFORM l8l   
  
below.   
  
As with Bauer's, Benet's leadership offered some service to every-   
one involved: the officials got their whipping boy, who at the same   
time effectively conveyed their pressures to the group; Ben6t him-   
self derived an emotional satisfaction from the pain-and-punish-   
ment pattern; and the other Westerners, through BeneYs own   
absorption of punishment, were afforded some degree of protection   
from the renewed assaults. But such histrionic and chaotic leader-   
ship could not be expected to last, and Benet's style soon became   
universally disturbing: the officials could not trust such an exag-   
gerated performance, especially when they noted his declining   
influence upon his fellow Europeans; the other Westerners were   
made hostile and antagonistic to Ben& and to each other by the   
loss of their group independence and solidarity, and — worst of all —   
by the loss of the capacity to test emotional and intellectual realities;   
Benet himself began to break down under the strain. All of the   
Westerners, including Benet, were pressured toward a disintegra-   
tion of identity and a strong sense of guilt.   
  
On the whole, Benet's style also was more compatible with his   
own emotional needs than with those of the led. Ben£t, the   
"marvelous actor," was able to take a histrionic plunge and still   
land mostly on his feet, as his later attitudes suggest. But the other   
Westerners, who lacked this talent, could never trust him suf-   
ficiently to be certain that he was truly identified with them in   
their struggle to preserve values and group cohesion, rather than   
with his captors' demands for confession and reform. Under these   
conditions, one can play no "game": the whole thing becomes   

----------------------- Page 161-----------------------

"real," and personal accusations are a true threat to one's sense of   
self.   
  
Were these circumstances created by the demanding outer   
milieu, or by Benet's special character traits? We can only say that   
the small group became a captive audience for both.   
  
The third style of leadership may be termed flexible adaptation   
and preservation of identity. This was undoubtedly the most re-   
markable phase of the group's existence. Still subjected to extremely   
disruptive pressures, its members somehow managed to achieve a   
restoration of trust. How did this come about?   
  
An emotional demand for a change in style came from all three   
directions. The group of Westerners' urge for survival made them   
  
182 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
cast about for some alternative to the painful confusion of BeneVs   
leadership; the environment slightly toned down its assaults in order   
to pursue its reform process on a more even keel; and a potential   
replacement for Ben6t appeared, a man of unusual humility and   
integrity — a man who also had the necessary knowledge of Chinese.   
Vechten brought to his leadership an emphasis upon moderation   
because this had always been his emphasis; he brought the men to-   
gether skilfully, emphasizing what they shared, and activating the   
best in each of them because this had long been his method of deal-   
ing with conflict — conflict among others and within himself. His   
was the gift of the creative man: the capacity to make use of inner   
struggles to evolve a new form which can both express personal   
emotions and strike deep chords of feeling in others. In human   
relations, he was a true artist; and like any artist, his own wellbeing   
depended upon his continuous creativity. He was inwardly impelled   
as well as outwardly encouraged to take an active role in guiding the   
fortunes of the group: his own self-control and his sense of clerical   
identity demanded it.   
  
Again there were satisfactions to be derived from his leadership   
for all three elements, but this time, in contrast to the previous two   
stages, there were more satisfactions for the other Westerners than   
for either the officials or for the leader himself. The resuscitated   
Europeans had their group independence restored, and found a   
means of mutual emotional support. The officials seem to have   
benefited the least, although from their standpoint, Vechten was   
still an active enough reformer.   
  
For Vechten himself, the benefits of his leadership were most   
contradictory. He did derive the satisfaction of doing, and doing   
well, what inner needs and outer demands required of him. His   
talent for moderation, however, conflicted with the more im-   
moderate (and totalistic) ideal of martyrdom against which every   
Catholic priest, when under extreme duress, must in some degree   

----------------------- Page 162-----------------------

measure himself — a self-judgment likely to be part icularly severe in   
a man for whom complete integrity is essential. In a study leader   
this conflict is especially intense, because of the continuous com-   
promises he must make. Further, Vechten's give-and-take approach   
could not permit him to be conveniently absolute in his judgments   
(in the manner of Bauer or Ben£t), but rather required him to   
  
GROUP REFORM 183   
  
question continuously his own ideas and to weigh them against   
the points of view of the others. Finally, the style of deception   
which he and the other Westerners worked out was more compli-   
cated than either the academic iconoclasm of Bauer or the all-or-   
none submersion of Benet. It is no surprise that under these cir-   
cumstances, earlier problems of feeling unloved, inferior, and over-   
whelmed by his own anger once more emerged. And any problem   
for Vechten immediately became a problem for the entire group,   
which had, after all, never rid itself of its antagonisms. Vechten's   
preservation of autonomy, both of the group and of the individual,   
under conditions such as these was one of the most unusual human   
achievements I met with during the course of this study.   
  
In evaluating these three patterns of leadership (and I have   
made them, for purposes of clarity, perhaps a bit more sharply   
defined than they really were), I have tried to make it clear that   
neither the milieu, the leader, nor the led were solely responsible   
for producing a particular style of behavior. Rather, each phase is an   
example of the principle (as valid for psychology as for physics and   
medicine) of multiple causation. It would be wrong to say, for   
instance, that Vechten's emergence as a leader was entirely due   
to his character traits, although it is probable that, because of his   
outstanding qualities, he would become a leader of most groups in   
most situations. The point is that he was a particularly appropriate   
leader of this group at this time. It may well be that Bauer's intel-   
lectual attainments would have kept him the leader, even if   
Vechten had been present, during the lax early phase, and that   
Benet's "progressive" histrionics would have made him the most   
likely leader during the time when political levels had to be   
"raised." Also, leadership styles may vary in the same man. Had   
Bauer experienced stronger personal pressures before he came into   
the group, his leadership could have been a good deal less firm;   
had Benet been less fearful, his leadership might have been less   
extreme. Leadership leaves a good deal of room for heroism; but this   
heroism is intimately related to the peculiar demands which prevail   
in a particular environment at a given time.   
  
This group experience also suggests that we re-examine and   
expand our concepts (and stereotypes) of "The Leader." 2 Father   
Vechten's impressive performance demonstrates the leadership

potential of the man who can mediate with integrity, who can set   
an example which helps other men retain their identity and adapt   
with dignity. It may be that during our age of ideological excess, it   
is he, rather than his more flamboyant and charismatic counterpart,   
who is needed.   
  
CHAPTER   
  
FOLLOW-UP VISITS   
  
What happened to these twenty-five people in the   
years after their thought reform experiences? When   
I saw most of them in Hong Kong, they were in what was clearly a   
transitional state, a brief period of stocktaking before their return   
to a permanent, non-Communist, Western way of life. I felt then   
that many were about to meet emotional challenges almost as dif-   
ficult as those they had just faced. Some of these psychological   
problems were inherent in their strong sense of guilt and shame,   
and in conflicts over where they stood in relationship to their pro-   
fessions, to their sacred personal commitments, and to themselves.   
Of course I could not predict exactly what was in store for them;   
I was, however, very much interested in finding out. And my efforts   
were further stimulated by comments of colleagues and friends:   
"What you say about thought reform is all very well — but what   
about the long-term effects? Do these people undergo a new course   
of 'brainwashing' in the environment to which they return?"   
  
I kept in touch with many of my subjects by mail: some wrote to   
me on their own, wishing to continue our relationship, and others   
responded to a follow-up questionnaire which I sent out when I   
returned to America. But my real opportunity for learning about   
the residual effects of thought reform came during the summer of   
1958, when I was scheduled to spend two months in Japan in con-   
nection with another psychiatric study. I decided to go by way of   
  
185   
  
l86 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
Europe in order to revisit some of my subjects in their Western   
settings; and I also arranged to meet one of them in South Asia   
where he had returned to do missionary work.   
  
I was able to obtain information about twenty-one of my twenty-   
five subjects. I especially sought personal interviews with those   
people with whom I had worked intensively in Hong Kong; and in   
meeting them once more, I was struck by how different they looked   
to me, as well as by the strange combinations of emotions which   
they expressed. I felt they had personally served as battlegrounds for   
the conflicting ideologies of our time, and had been victims of the   
many kinds of alienation peculiar to the twentieth century.   
  

----------------------- Page 164-----------------------

I will start with the members of the Western group, and then   
return to the others who were discussed in earlier chapters.   
  
Father Vechten   
  
Father Vechten wrote to me several times in the four years be-   
tween our meetings. Still the group's central figure, he kept in   
touch with all the others, and sent me some of their latest ad-   
dresses. He had also informed me of a tragic motorbike accident   
in which he nearly lost his life three weeks after his arrival in Hol-   
land. From his hospital bed, he had written of his feeling of shame   
"for my moral, human, mental, ideological defects which I have   
suffered in prison. . . . For having been weak, without principle,   
even harming others in co-operating with Communism." And he   
described his great longing for the chance to "continue my mission-   
work among the Chinese."   
  
When we were seated across a table in his austere room, in his   
small seminary in the Dutch farmlands, I was struck by the re-   
moteness and quiet of his new environment, so different from the   
sense of urgency and involvement which had existed during our   
interviews in Hong Kong. Father Vechten had to some extent   
blended with this milieu: as he talked of such things as "moral   
faults" (while puffing on a large cigar), he seemed more the re-   
turned Dutch priest than the "Chinese" missionary and group   
leader I had known in Hong Kong. But it was not long before he   
began to express the more profound emotions he had experienced   
since his return; and as he described those first few weeks, the events   
seemed to follow with the psychological inevitability of Greek   
  
FOLLOW-UP VISITS   
  
tragedy.   
  
Vechten had stopped briefly in Rome on his way home. It was   
a visit of the deepest significance for him, at once magnifying his   
pain, symbolizing his complete return to the embrace of the   
Church, and accelerating his new changes in attitude.   
  
When I arrived in Rome, things became more urgent for me. . . .   
When I entered St. Peter's, I shed tears just before the chair of Peter.   
I had suffered. I was much impressed. . . . My way of thinking and   
judging became more that which I had formerly.    
  
In Rome he made a detailed confession in which he told of all   
he had said and done in prison which could be considered against   
the Church's interests. He told his confessor of his embarrassment   
at being considered a hero, and asked whether he was required to   
tell others of the extent of his co-operation and "weakness"; he was   
relieved by the confessor's reassurance that he was not obliged to   
talk about shortcomings, and should feel "no need to humiliate   
yourself."   

----------------------- Page 165-----------------------

  
Arriving in Holland he felt "rather serene" because "there was   
no more feeling that I had not made things right." He was, how-   
ever, struck by the contrast between his own and others' views of   
his prison experiences:   
  
When I was asked to speak on the radio, I did not know what to say.   
The superior asked me: "Were you always in a cell?" I said, "Sure, for   
one-and-one-half years I was not out of the cell." He considered this   
terrible, so I told it over the radio. I hadn't realized it was so bad. I   
considered it normal. People were astonished and I was astonished that   
the people were astonished.   
  
The warmth of the greetings which he received from family,   
fellow priests, and villagers affected him greatly: "Contact with   
people ... with love for each other . . . who admired and didn't   
ask about faults . . . was of great importance. ... If I had not   
been so well received, I should have been a broken man and useless   
in society."   
  
But he was nonetheless troubled by recurrent anxiety dreams, in   
one of which he was in a Chinese Communist prison for a second   
time, again preoccupied with "trying to escape from difficulties for   
myself and for the group." In this dream he also asked himself,   
  
l88 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
"Why have you been so foolish as to go back to China?" In his   
waking life, too, he experienced a similar fear, so that when he   
requested he be returned to a Chinese area, he also asked that he   
be permitted to leave before any Communist occupation, should   
this occur: "I thought, 'Never a second time'."   
  
And his sense of shame and guilt could not be stilled. He kept   
thinking that if he had been physically tortured, as some other   
priests had, his concessions might have been justified. "But I had   
not been tortured. Why have I come to such deeds?" During this   
early period, it was almost impossible for him to talk about his   
prison experiences. He did, on one occasion, tell a colleague a few   
of the things he confessed; but when the latter gave evidence of   
surprise, Vechten felt deeply upset. On the other hand, he con-   
demned himself for holding back this information: "I thought to   
myself that it was a lack of humility, because you don't like other   
people to consider you so weak." He could find no relief from his   
suffering, despite considerate, and often psychologically sensitive   
attitudes on the part of his fellow-priests.   
  
Nor could he permit himself to rest as others suggested that he   
do; he felt almost immediately an urge to be active. "I had one   
strong idea; I had lost three years of working time, and I had to   
make up for it, to work more and be as busy as possible." In re-   
sponse to invitations, he preached and lectured repeatedly, less   

----------------------- Page 166-----------------------

about his imprisonment than about Catholic activities in China.   
  
He also, soon after his return, became fascinated with the new   
motorbikes, never having seen this type before. He immediately   
decided to buy one, despite warnings from family and friends who   
— possibly sensing his agitation and his adjustment difficulties —   
told him that it might be dangerous for him to ride one. These   
warnings had little effect upon him because of his sense of invulner-   
ability ("I felt that nothing could happen to me"), and his con-   
viction that, with increased mobility, "I would be free."   
  
He decided to use his new motorbike to travel part of the way   
to a nearby conference of Catholic missionaries who had been re-   
cently released from Chinese prisons. The conference was emo-   
tionally loaded for him : he was pleased at being invited by a group   
of distinguished colleagues, but apprehensive about meeting one of   
them who had been together with him in a cell for a brief period   
during which time Vechten had exerted a slightly "progressive" in-   
  
FOLLOW-UP VISITS 189   
  
fluence. When he was returning a few days later, he started to   
turn off on a back road not far from his home, only to find that the   
road had been closed during his absence. As he crossed the main   
highway to reroute himself, he was struck from behind by a car, and   
suffered severe head and leg injuries; he spent the next two years in   
hospitals, undergoing a long series of difficult operations. It was   
significant that he was told by others (he did not remember him-   
self) that in a semiconscious state soon after the accident he   
answered a policeman's questions in a manner which placed all   
the blame upon himself.   
  
Despite his concern with his physical state, he told me that he   
"enjoyed" his hospital experience. Not only was it a relief from his   
immediate struggles, but it seemed to answer a deep longing:   
  
Sometimes when I was in prison I thought, "Some day you will come   
back to Holland, to a clean bed, and people will take care of you." In   
the hospital it happened exactly as I had imagined.   
  
This period of hospitalization also served as a useful interlude   
during which he was able to prepare himself for life in the Western   
world. "In the beginning I said that I never will succeed in adapt-   
ing myself to Holland as it is now. . . . But in the hospital I   
began to understand the Dutch way of thinking, to read and   
study. ... It did me a lot of good to have a long rest in the   
hospital."   
  
I was convinced that Vechten's emotional conflicts had played   
a very important role in bringing about his accident. His experi-   
ence in Rome had symbolized a return to a more "pure" Catholic   
identity; it had also intensified his sense of guilt and shame about   

----------------------- Page 167-----------------------

his prison behavior, guilt and shame which not even his religious   
confession could erase. Physical torture in prison might have of-   
fered inner justification, as well as more concrete punishment, for   
his compromises; his accident supplied the punishment which he   
unconsciously sought. It also satisfied his strong desire to lie back   
and be cared for, a passive longing which reflected the human   
tendency to regress to earlier forms of emotional satisfaction when   
under great duress. In addition, the accident fulfilled his need to   
withdraw from his outer environment — now inappropriately viewed   
as accusatory — in order to come to better terms with his inner self.   
His exaggerated activity had been largely a form of compensation,   
  
I90 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
an unsuccessful attempt to master the situation through external   
action rather than introspection, and — as it turned out — a round-   
about route to the more passive goal. 1 Caught between painful and   
unresolved conflicts in both his prison and his Catholic identities,   
he found his solution through a third and more transitional identity,   
that of the hospital patient.   
  
Father Vechten later recognized that his injuries had served as   
a substitute expression for a psychological condition and that his   
hospitalization offered him an opportunity for psychological re-   
covery.   
  
It benefited me very much in a spiritual sense. . . . Other people told   
me that before I had looked so wild, so restless. Afterwards in the hos-   
pital, little by little, I became normal once more. ... If I didn't   
have the accident, something else would have happened — perhaps a   
mental breakdown.   
  
He become "normal" by bringing into the open and coming to   
better terms with his feelings about thought reform and about   
China; these problems were, for Father Vechten, unusually com-   
pelling.   
  
Indeed, he began to unburden himself (once more he could not   
remember having done so) when still in a semiconscious state:   
"After the accident, they could not speak to me about anything but   
China, the nurses told me." A few months later, he discussed with   
a senior Church official his feeling that his behavior had not been   
justified because he had not been physically tortured; and h e was   
much relieved by his colleague's reassurance that those who had   
been so tortured had been in a situation no more difficult than his,   
and that he had been no less brave than they. Vechten considered   
these words a turning point in his recovery. They had the effect of   
a valid and reassuring psychotherapeutic interpretation, made at   
a time when the patient is ready to receive it. After that Vechten   
felt encouraged to talk more about his experiences, and he also   
read everything he could find on the general subject of brainwash-   
ing or thought reform: "It was the one subject which could   

----------------------- Page 168-----------------------

captivate my imagination." He has since continued these explora-   
tions: "I am always looking to find an explanation, especially one   
which could give me more assurance." Gradually, after leaving the   
hospital, he began to write and speak about his own experiences,   
  
FOLLOW-UP VISITS 191   
  
and to formulate his own analysis of the process. In the continuing   
struggle for mastery, he had gained much ground.   
  
His difficulties over being separated from China were greatly   
eased by a professional assignment which involved translating   
Chinese documents. Moreover, during his hospital stay, he was   
able to discuss China to his heart's content with other patients and   
staff members — while at the same time absorbing, in small and   
relatively painless doses, the Dutch Catholic environment from   
which he was protectively shielded by the hospital itself. Nor had   
he severed his ties with China even after he left the hospital. He   
still made an effort to meet with other China missionaries; they   
would sometimes speak in Chinese and call each other by their   
Chinese names. And in talking to ordinary colleagues, he found it   
necessary to check himself constantly to avoid "always talking about   
China." Despite his fear of again falling into Communist hands,   
he was still trying to arrange to return to a Chinese cultural area to   
work. He had by no means cast off his "Chinese" self, but he had   
come to better terms with it. "There remains my great love for   
China and all that is Chinese; but now I should be able to accustom   
myself to the Dutch way too."   
  
During the years after his release, Vechten's ideological position   
regarding Communism hardened:   
  
Before being in prison I was much opposed to the Communists because   
I regarded them as enemies of religion. . . . Now my opposition is   
greater and I hate them because they are opposed to humanity. . . .   
I see now the enormous danger to the human person to be under   
Communism — more even than just its opposition to religion.   
  
He had also become more critical of socialist movements in his   
own country which favored more government controls. He ad-   
vocated the "co-operative" form of social welfare described in of-   
ficial Catholic sociology as an alternative to the Communist class   
struggle. In all expressions of political opinion, he combined these   
personal and official approaches.   
  
Toward the end of my two-day visit with Vechten, we discussed   
some of the long-range effects of thought reform upon his personal   
character. He described an "increased guilt consciousness" which   
included not only a highly critical attitude toward himself, but an   
insistence that others maintain it toward themselves as well. When   
  
192 THOUGHT REFORM   

----------------------- Page 169-----------------------

  
a colleague, for instance, during a game of table tennis placed the   
blame for a bad shot on the racket, Vechten replied — whimsically   
but meaningfully — "You don't recognize your own faults. You   
should be put in prison in China and then you would be taught   
what is really your fault and what is due to other things." He was   
defending by this remark the general importance of personal guilt   
and responsibility; and yet it was significant that he chose to use   
thought reform as a specific (and affirmative) example. Even among   
priests, he was considered "too guilt-conscious."   
  
As I have already noted, Vechten's tendency toward guilt did   
not originate with thought reform. In discussing it, he recalled that   
between the ages of eighteen and twenty-two he had been preoc-   
cupied with avoiding sin, and with a fear that he was, as much as   
he tried, not telling all during confession. He retained a similar   
attitude toward revealing in full detail his prison "sins"; he was   
more aware of consciously holding back, but he always felt guilty   
about doing so. He also gave a classical description of his sense of   
shame: "I am ashamed I could not be as strong as others supposed   
I should be." But like many such descriptions, it was incomplete:   
he suffered not so much from failing to live up to others' standards   
as from having internalized these standards (however unrealizable),   
so that he became his own worst critic in matters of shame as well   
as of guilt.   
  
He felt, however, that both the shame and guilt were becoming   
attenuated because of his gradual acquisition of the distance from,   
understanding of, and perspective on the thought reform process   
which he had so lacked when he had arrived in Europe: "These   
feelings are diminishing a lot, because I can better see the whole   
impact of brainwashing. I can explain now why, with my full   
consent, I have come to such things as I now consider not good."   
He emphasized that my talks with him in Hong Kong had been   
of some help; and at that time I did have the impression that he   
was beginning to come to grips with his prison experiences. His   
subsequent difficulties, however, suggest that he had actually been   
a long way from any genuine insight; and his experience confirmed   
the psychiatric truism that insight is not a thing of the moment,   
but is rather a continuous and repetitious form of inner recognition   
which is always contested by antagonistic emotions.   
  
Apart from this "increased guilt-consciousness," about whose   
  
FOLLOW-UP VISITS 193   
  
value Father Vechten had mixed feelings, he described a series of   
more indirect effects which were more clearly positive. He said that   
he had become "more optimistic about people" because of ob-   
serving other prisoners' impressive behavior. He felt more confident   
about meeting people of higher standing, and less apt to believe   
himself unworthy of their presence. He had retained the "Chinese   

----------------------- Page 170-----------------------

way" of avoiding direct refusal, preferring to say "Yes, I will" to   
requests for his services even when he knew he would not be able to   
do what was asked. He felt "more able to make jokes about things   
that are difficult" — about his return to "normality" after the prison   
experience, about the results of his accident, about future problems;   
and he found himself advising his students to face their difficulties   
with a sense of humor. Without attempting to speculate extensively   
about the meaning of all of these effects, we can summarize them   
as: 1) an intensification of old traits: susceptibility to guilt and   
shame, and a strong conciliatory tendency, now with a Chinese   
flavor; and 2) a general expansion of his emotional horizons, lead-   
ing to an increased receptivity to his own feelings and those of   
others. Father Vechten had spent four years overcoming an in-   
appropriate sense of defeat; the problem was still with him, but he   
was making psychological use of it to emerge as a more developed   
human being.   
  
I have described Father Vechten's experiences in some detail   
because they shed light not only on his personal struggle, but on   
the general psychological patterns typical of most Western sub-   
jects. Before summarizing these patterns (see C hapter 12), I will   
first discuss briefly the other group members. Of those I had met   
in Hong Kong, two (Kallmann and Emile) were available for fol-   
low-up visits. The other two were geographically inaccessible to me,   
but I was able to learn something about them, and about Benet,   
from the three group members I did interview, as well as from   
correspondence.   
  
The Kallmanns   
  
When I met Mr. Kallmann in his modest but attractive apart-   
ment in a small West German city, he presented many-sided views   
of the world and of himself. He had followed through in the inten-   
  
 194 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
tion he had expressed in Hong Kong, and had returned to the ideals   
of his youth. Condemning the postwar tendency "not to believe in   
anything," he sought out many old friends from his youth move-   
ment days, and not only tried to maintain close relations with them,   
but also established with them a youth group for their children.   
This gave him some satisfaction, but it did not produce the ideo-   
logical absorption for which he had hoped.   
  
He was, in fact, caught up in the very pattern which he com-   
plained about. Rather than believing in "nothing," he believed in,   
and felt some part of himself to be, practically everything — which   
is almost the same thing. He alternated between being an outspoken   
critic of Communism, who found the Communist world "just   
utterly unacceptable. . . . beyond human dignity" and who be-   
came angry when visiting dignitaries "naively" accepted Com-   
munist propaganda during trips to China; an explainer and to some   

----------------------- Page 171-----------------------

extent a justifier of Chinese Communism — he wrote me, "In spite   
of my very adverse experiences, I take a positive view towards the   
things in China," and when I saw him he emphasized the regime's   
accomplishments and his willingness to "give credit" and extend   
himself to be fair in his judgments; a moderator between East and   
West, who stressed his love for the Chinese people and imagined   
the possibility of being invited to China by Mao Tse-tung to help   
bring together the opposing camps; an "Old China Hand," who   
remembered his life in the Far East fondly, and who set his expert   
personal knowledge against the ignorance of those who had not   
been there; a German bourgeois merchant, struggling to re-establish   
his business and deeply concerned with the welfare of his family;   
a nostalgic Nazi, who quoted the opinion of friends that the move-   
ment "could have succeeded" — he had himself been a Nazi when   
in China, and although he was very critical of many of its features,   
he nonetheless felt it had been a "genuine people's movement";   
and a new believer in democracy, who had read a number of books   
on the subject, favored his country's postwar democratic methods,   
and tried diligently to indoctrinate his family with the principles   
of freedom and responsibility which he considered to be the basis   
of democracy.   
  
He maintained an extremely active interest in China, Chinese   
Communism, and thought reform; and he lectured, wrote, and   
sought out prominent people he wished to influence with his views.   
  
FOLLOW-UP VISITS 195   
  
In attempting to achieve what he termed "resonance" with his   
audiences, he was reversing the thought reform situation {he was   
now exerting the influence) as well as expressing his desire for   
human intimacy.   
  
Although he emphasized to me the depth of his suffering under   
thought reform, he had tried to adopt one of its main features —   
a planned program of criticism and self-criticism — within his own   
family. He claimed he was using it to instill democracy, and his   
slogan was "The Democratic Family." He had organized family   
gatherings at which children and parents were to criticize them-   
selves and each other, but this program was something less than a   
glowing success. His young children, ignorant of adult techniques   
for playing the game, at first frankly confessed their sins: one would   
reveal that he had been bad at school, while another would admit   
that he had stayed on the toilet a particularly long time in order to   
avoid the chore of drying dishes. They soon caught on, however,   
and began to find themselves having "too much homework" when-   
ever the time for the evening sessions arrived. Nor did they wel-   
come the opportunity to criticize their parents; they made it clear   
that equality was not what they wanted, and that they preferred   
their mother and father to take over. Kallmann himself began to   
see the program's limitation: "It was as if I had lined them up and   
had them all undressed." He had not given up the idea entirely,   

----------------------- Page 172-----------------------

but he had come to the conclusion that "even children want to have   
some sphere of privacy."   
  
Kallmann's path was not easy. He tried to look upon thought   
reform as "something that has passed," but he found that the ex-   
perience had left him "more sensitive" in many ways. Since his   
return, he had experienced phobic symptoms (fear of policemen,   
of crowds, of large cities), periods of profound anxiety sometimes   
related to family and business problems, rather severe physical ill-   
ness, and episodes of moderate depression. These had diminished;   
but he did mention that he would still at times feel envious of   
those who, through death, no longer had to face the struggles of   
existence. Some (and perhaps all) of these symptom patterns had   
been present during crises in his life prior to imprisonment. I felt   
that he was having great difficulty establishing a new sense of   
identity after having hit rock bottom during his reform. He was   
genuinely pursuing the ideological ideal of democracy which he   
  
I96 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
had adopted; yet the extreme diffusion of his multiple identities   
made it difficult for him to develop a coherent pattern, whether of   
self or of belief. While he denied conscious feelings of guilt, he had   
clearly been unable to divest himself of thought reform's humilia-   
tion, and of the compounded shame and guilt which this included.   
Because of his diffuse self-image, he remained extremely vulnerable   
to others' attitudes, easily hurt by criticism, encouraged by praise.   
Withal, he remained loyal to the Western group experience and   
retained his warm attitudes toward the other men; he had been able   
to arrange to see most of them, and was still Father Benet's   
staunchest defender.   
  
Mrs. Kallman's response made an interesting contrast to her   
husband's. She had also been in prison in China, and arrangements   
had been made for them to leave the country together. She de-   
scribed to me their dramatically silent jeep ride to the pier (still   
in police custody, they were forbidden to talk), their silence long   
after the Communist guard had left them alone in their cabin on   
the European-owned ship, while both of them looked up at the   
ventilators fearing that they might be overheard; and finally, their   
speaking to each other only when they were certain that they were   
out of Chinese waters.   
  
Her responses after prison were simpler and a good deal less   
ambivalent than her husband's. She hated the Communists for   
what they had done to her husband and herself. She disapproved of   
her husband's lectures because she feared that they might cause   
him trouble in the future. She and her husband had discussed their   
prison experiences at great length; now she wished to forget about   
them and devote her energies to her family. She did not escape   
aftereffects — recurrent dreams and a certain amount of physical   
and psychosomatic illness — and we may assume that she was not   

----------------------- Page 173-----------------------

entirely free of inner doubts. But she remained the stronger of the   
two, offering continual emotional support to her husband. She also   
felt that, in their marriage, thought reform had made them both   
more conciliatory. She was very "female" in her entirely personal   
and nonideological judgments, although, as we have seen with Miss   
Darrow, such a response was by no means characteristic of every   
woman who experienced thought reform.   
  
FOLLOW-UP VISITS 197   
  
Father Emile   
  
I visited Father Emile at a mission house in southern France.   
Robust, confident, and energetic, he bore little resemblance to   
the tense and confused man I had seen in Hong Kong. In char-   
acteristic fashion, he opened our talk with several humorous anec-   
dotes about his experiences during and after imprisonment. Indeed,   
his sense of humor was his mainstay in his recovery ("I took it   
lightly, not tragically"), so much so that he was concerned lest he   
deal with these matters "too much as a joke." Like other priests, he   
had experienced a certain amount of remorse about things he had   
said and done which might hurt the Church. He was especially con-   
cerned about a Chinese priest who might have been endangered by   
his words, and extended this concern to all Chinese priests: "Now   
I suffer about Chinese fathers. ... I am afraid they might feel we   
betrayed them." Most foreign priests shared these sentiments about   
imprisoned Chinese colleagues, but Emile carried it to the point   
of insisting upon sleeping on a wooden bed without a mattress —   
much as he did in jail — "to show my sympathy for them."   
  
He too had retained his passion for China, and looked all over   
France for friends he had known there. When asked if he wished   
to take up missionary activities in another part of the world, his   
answer was: "I have been married to China — and I am faithful to   
my first wife." So intense was his interest in speaking and writing   
about thought reform and other aspects of Chinese Communism   
that he neglected his first teaching assignment; he was then trans-   
ferred to a new position which allowed him contact with Chinese   
missionary activities. During this period he became extremely inter-   
ested in supplying detailed information to an international group   
which was investigating forced labor practices throughout the   
world. He much preferred this form of activity to concentrating   
upon his new French surroundings; after two decades in China,   
Europe seemed so alien to him that "I thought I needed another   
re-education."   
  
When I saw him in France, his anti-Communist position was   
firm ("They don't even consider elementary human rights"), and   
more outspoken than it had been in Hong Kong, although perhaps   
  
198 THOUGHT REFORM   
  

----------------------- Page 174-----------------------

a bit less vehement than it had been one year after his return — in   
a letter to me then he spoke of the "mixture of threats, wheedling,   
and blackmail" characteristic of thought reform. He had also be-   
come more accustomed to life in France, and had achieved a   
balance between his continuing interest in China and his involve-   
ment in his immediate environment.   
  
Father Emile still conceded that the thought reform method   
had "some good" in its ability to get to the "root of the bad   
thought." He also believed the Communist stress upon communal   
co-operation was valuable. He had remained on good, though not   
intimate, terms with the other group members. He tended to avoid   
extensive introspection concerning his experience, preferring to   
deal with it in an "active way," and characterizing himself as   
"dynamic rather than speculative." His recovery was, on the whole,   
quite impressive. He had (in contrast to Father Vechten) been   
able to deal effectively and promptly with his guilt and shame   
within the idiom of the Catholic priesthood. This accomplished,   
he was free to make good use of humor and activity as a means of   
further detoxifying these dangerous post-release emotions, and   
creating distance between himself and the prison experience.   
  
What about the other three men?   
  
Mr. Weber (the businessman-adventurer) paid a warm visit to   
Father Vechten almost immediately after their return to Europe,   
during which he received the sacraments from his previous cellmate   
in a formal resumption of Catholic religious life. But almost im-   
mediately afterward he apparently went back to his former style of   
existence: active engagement in commerce and adventure in an   
underdeveloped country, supported by a liberal indulgence in   
alcohol. Most of the others in the group retained an affectionate,   
if not fully admiring, feeling for Weber, and believed this resump-   
tion of his previous pattern to be inevitable because of his "in-   
stability."   
  
Dr. Bauer had lived up to his impressive Hong Kong perform-   
ance. He had been able to resume medical practice almost im-   
mediately, and had re-established his family in a European-in-   
habited area far from Europe itself. In letters to me, he denied   
psychological difficulties of any variety, described his continuing   
antagonism to Communism ("I feel hot under the collar about it   
  
FOLLOW-UP VISITS 199   
  
in general"), and considered himself to be "a scientific witness of   
unpleasant experiments." On this basis he had lectured extensively   
during the months after his return. He continued to make friendly   
overtures toward other group members, to which they were not un-   
responsive; but most of the others experienced mixed feelings   
toward him, remembering with admiration his courage and support   
during imprisonment, but at the same time being unable to recon-   

----------------------- Page 175-----------------------

cile antagonisms related to his Nazi background, racist views, and   
to certain of his personal traits.   
  
Father Benet's readjustment was apparently a bit more stormy,   
as might be expected. According to a colleague who accompanied   
him, Benet had experienced "a kind of crisis" during the boat trip   
back to Europe which was apparently related to his overwhelming   
fear — no longer fear of the Communists, but rather of his own   
Church superiors because of his behavior during imprisonment.   
But it was not long before he too was able to resume his profes-   
sional activities. When he did, however, and began to give talks   
about his prison experiences, he emphasized (as he explained in a   
letter to one of the others) how the missionaries had deceived them-   
selves, how much they had been humiliated, how close they had   
been brought to complete breakdown. He thus still maintained a   
histrionic posture of exhibitionism and masochism. As one colleague   
expressed it, "He is still playing a game — now on the other side."   
Moreover, Benet claimed that the man to whom he wrote the   
letter mentioned above had been "near a nervous breakdown" him-   
self — a part of this posture, and at the same time a means of   
projecting his own state on to someone else. The other group   
members maintained many of the critical feelings toward him they   
had expressed upon their release; but these had, on the whole,   
tended to soften over the years.   
  
Of those prisoners discussed in earlier chapters, I have follow-up   
information about all but one, Dr. Vincent. I was not surprised   
when he failed to respond to my letters, and I was unable to obtain   
any definite information about him. An acquaintance of his told me   
that Vincent had been trying to arrange to return to medical work   
in another part of Asia; since this was consistent with the plans   
Vincent had described to me, it is probably what happened. We   
may also assume that he regained his exaggerated possession of   
  
200 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
his "insides" and reverted to his distinctive identity of the   
mystical healer.   
  
Father Luca   
  
About Father Luca, I have more definite knowledge. When I   
visited him at his family home in a medium-sized Italian city, I   
encountered a man different from the driven, restless, and probing   
missionary I had met in Hong Kong. He was a friendly and forceful   
priest, lively and definite in his discussion of everything Chinese,   
and at the same time quite at home in his middle-class European   
surroundings. He was now physically healthy — he had recovered   
from his back injuries and gained a good deal of weight — and   
emotionally assertive rather than self-questioning.   
  
He had not found Europe too difficult to get used to — he had   

----------------------- Page 176-----------------------

not been away nearly as long as many of the others — but he had ex-   
perienced the painful inner struggle which, from our talks in Hong   
Kong, I knew he could not escape. He was deeply moved by his   
reunion with family members and colleagues; but he found himself   
troubled by feelings of confusion and sadness. He related these   
to his separation from China and from his Chinese friends, and to   
his uncertain physical condition, thus tending to minimize his   
sense of guilt. He came to crave useful activity, and chafed under   
his physician's prescription of extended rest. He achieved an active   
solution similar to the one utilized by many of my other subjects.   
He prepared an extensive evaluation of Communist reform prac-   
tices for the group investigating concentration camps and forced   
labor, an evaluation which included opinions about both the re-   
formers and the reformed. When this was completed, he began, on   
his own initiative, a much more ambitious piece of work: a de-   
tailed study and analysis of the life and letters of the founder of his   
society, an outstanding figure among modern missionaries to China.   
As he proceeded with this study, Father Luca compared his own   
religious experiences, in Europe as well as in China, with those of   
a man who had long served as his ideal, and this project helped   
him greatly in his continual struggle to define himself in relation-   
ship to the Church and to China. Moreover, he was able to work   
on both these tasks during a time when his physical activities were   
restricted.   
  
FOIXOW-UP VISITS 201   
  
Soon after, he began to make strong efforts to educate others   
about the realities of Communist China — by briefing people pre-   
paring for visits, writing magazine articles, and appearing at public   
debates. His voice rose as he described to me the "naivete of some   
people who refuse to recognize that persecutions exist in Com-   
munist China." His sense of personal integrity was clearly involved   
in these matters — so much so, that on one occasion he sought out   
the leader of an official group of Communist Chinese visitors,   
described the brutality he had experienced in prison, and urged   
this man to request his government to admit (making use, if neces-   
sary, of some face-saving maneuver) that the "people it said were   
guilty were really not guilty." Luca also continued to advocate a   
liberal course in future missionary activities, recommending more   
self-expression and local authority among indigenous groups. He   
could still admit that the Chinese Communists were "right" about   
some things, and that the missionaries had made mistakes; but his   
general tone when he referred to the present regime, as compared   
to his attitude in Hong Kong, had become more militantly critical   
and more consistently hostile.   
  
He had remained concerned about the possible harm some of the   
statements in his confession might have caused to the Church and   
its representatives. He was especially troubled about the letter he   
had written under duress to a young Chinese Catholic girl de-   
nouncing his own organizational activities, and he had gone so far   

----------------------- Page 177-----------------------

as to send a gift to the girl through a countryman visiting China   
in order to rectify the situation. He felt hurt when the gift was   
refused, although he knew that the refusal was based on the girl's   
concern for her own safety. Nor was he free of his old nemeses: he   
still had trouble managing his emotions whenever he wished to   
oppose a superior, and he had to maintain his vigilance against   
ever-recurring sexual desires. But in all of these matters, I felt, his   
conflicts were under much better control than when I had last   
seen him. Like so many of the other imprisoned Westerners, Father   
Luca believed he had become more spontaneous and more fluent   
in his self-expression as a result of his thought reform: "I am more   
free in my behavior. ... I speak more easily in public and with   
other people." His spiritual life, he felt, had become more routine   
and "plain," in contrast to its precious intensity during imprison-   
ment: "then I had to seek an opportunity."   
  
202 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
When I asked him, near the end of our three-hour talk, whether   
any of the ideas of thought reform remained with him, he replied:   
"They come to mind, sometimes to be taken into account, some-   
times to be contradicted, sometimes to be accepted." He elaborated   
upon those ideas which he at least partially accepted:   
  
I agree that a way for the peasants to escape the moneylender when   
they needed credit was necessary. . . . Sometimes I have a feeling that   
a system of co-operatives can solve some of these problems. . . . Not   
necessarily the whole Marxist system. ... I had already a theoretical   
idea of this before, but 1 have a more sensitive idea of it now.   
  
In these ideas, as in all of his emotions, Father Luca was at-   
tempting to reconcile influences he felt he could not ignore with   
older respected values. He had found it necessary to repress much   
that was painful, especially those things related to feelings of guilt;   
and he had taken on some of the aspects of a conventional priest   
expressing the accepted ideas of the Church. Yet beneath, he   
fought a continuous struggle with his own most negative images of   
himself, and continuously searched for a personal synthesis. He   
had not been spared anxiety, but he had managed to make an effec-   
tive recovery without undue self-damage (had his prison injuries   
made this unnecessary?) or excessive inner distortion.   
  
Professor Castorp   
  
At the time of my trip to Europe, Professor Castorp, the sub-   
missive scientist, was well established in a teaching position in   
another part of Asia. He had, in fact, begun to make these new   
arrangements within weeks after his release. He wrote me a long   
and humorous letter describing his experiences since leaving Hong   
Kong. He mentioned family matters, but focused mainly upon   
problems of resuming his work — which to him meant resuming his   
existence as a self-respecting human being. He too wrote a report   

----------------------- Page 178-----------------------

of his prison experiences; but after he had completed this, he looked   
forward to returning to teaching and research in his more usual   
scientific areas.   
  
Professor Castorp at first was impeded by physical difficulties   
with his teeth, gums, and hearing, poor memory, easy fatigue, and   
worst of all, the loss of his former "pleasure and delight in solving   
  
FOIXOW-UP VISITS 203   
  
somewhat complicated problems." But gradually his enthusiasms   
returned, and he was able to look at his diminishing difficulties   
with his usual acceptance and detachment: "It may be . . . that   
a racehorse just has to race to keep fit, and if you put him in a   
stable for a long time, he does not race well any more in spite of   
good food." He was apparently following his long-standing pattern   
of blending with his new surroundings in his individualistic and   
somewhat withdrawn manner, and had already become an expert in   
the local geography. He retained his interest in thought reform   
and in problems of imprisonment; he also continued to feel some   
apprehension about the possibility of being captured again by the   
Communists. Characteristically, he made no mention of ideological   
issues; rather, he was concerned with practical matters. The letter,   
on the whole, confirmed my earlier impression of good recovery,   
and suggested that Professor Castorp had quickly and actively   
resumed his pre-thought reform identity.   
  
Bishop Barker   
  
I saw Bishop Barker (the elderly Belgian "priest, doctor, soldier")   
at an unusual but not inappropriate site — the Catholic shrine at   
Lourdes. He had led a pilgrimage there, and he suggested it as the   
most convenient place to meet, a suggestion which I welcomed.   
Now about seventy, he was an impressive figure in bishop's purple,   
his eyes alert, his movements quick, and his goatee pure white. In   
some ways he seemed more removed from other people (he ex-   
plained this as a continuation of his deepening religious sense), but   
at the same time he clearly enjoyed the adulation he received   
everywhere he went in Lourdes. As I observed him one day, taking   
part in a large Church processional, marching among other high   
Church officials in the privileged place behind the Holy Sacrament   
— his step slow and dignified, his lips moving in prayer — I thought   
that he had indeed come far from the deep humiliation of his   
thought reform.   
  
During the years since I had first seen him, Bishop Barker had   
continued his two crusades: his personal attempt to direct all of his   
emotions into a continuing Catholic religious experience, and his   
broader effort to spread his message about Chinese Communism   
and about reform techniques. He had spoken before many groups,   
  
204 THOUGHT REFORM   

----------------------- Page 179-----------------------

  
always bent upon "stirring up the audience to reform their inner   
life." He would stress both the power of the Communists and the   
need for sacrifice in order to "overcome" them. At the same time   
he 'emphasized that he was still "using the material of thought   
reform to deepen my own religious sense."   
  
His ideological interests — and in fact his major life interests —   
had become limited to Communism and Catholicism, and he con-   
cerned himself with political questions only when they were related   
to one or both of these. He had retained his strongly anti-Communist   
position; he admired John Foster Dulles and Konrad Adenauer   
as the two men "best against Communism." There was, at , the   
same time, some suggestion of ambivalence toward Americans:   
when I told him that my spoken French was far from fluent, he   
immediately replied, "No matter — your dollars speak for you all   
over the world." This was not a remarkable statement, of course,   
but it must be viewed in relationship to Bishop Barker's previous   
tendency to express unconsciously retained reform influences. His   
interest in thought reform continued only so long as he could   
discuss it in his own crusading Catholic idiom. When I questioned   
him about specific post-release feelings related to guilt and shame,   
he became evasive and suggested to me that the conversation was   
becoming a strain. He did tell me that if he were to be imprisoned   
again, he would "not give in at all," since the Communists distort   
any admission a prisoner makes. He had carried this attitude a   
step further, however, and he implied (and almost believed) that   
he had not given in at all during his actual prison experience.   
  
Thus, another one of my subjects was astounded to hear Barker   
say, during a brief meeting, that he had "not confessed anything."   
The Bishop did not say this to me, but he did limit his prison ref-   
erences to stories of outwitting his jailers and frustrating their in-   
tentions. After relating one of these anecdotes, he would quickly   
change the subject to his varied experiences during his long stay in   
China, again presenting himself in a heroic light and only oc-   
casionally permitting himself an admission of fear or nervousness.   
  
He also delighted in telling me of his Catholic religious life —   
of his greeting his guardian angel the first thing every morning, and   
of his feeling that in prison he needed an additional guardian angel   
and his calling upon the archangel Raphael. He asked me to attend   
one of his Masses; and — with minimal encouragement — he launched   
  
FOLLOW-UP VISITS 205   
  
into long discussions of theological symbolism. At the same time   
he enjoyed bringing up questions of morality and sexual behavior,   
presenting always a conventional Catholic viewpoint, but curious   
about a psychiatrist's opinions as well.   
  
I had the impression that Bishop Barker, keenly aware he was   

----------------------- Page 180-----------------------

living in his declining years, was attempting to assume a final iden-   
tity stance which would permit him to feel that his life had had   
value and meaning. In struggling to maintain the self-image of the   
hero — to which he had aspired since early childhood — he was still   
fighting off the inner voice which accused him instead of being   
the weakling. This underlying threat of despair made him much   
more comfortable in reaching for others' souls than in probing the   
psychological conflicts of his own. In dealing with thought reform   
experiences, he had not only intensified his tendency to repress and   
to deny: he had taken the next step, that of confabulation. Cer-   
tainly, during thought reform and in the rest of his life, as well, he   
had in many ways come close to realizing his heroic self-image; yet   
to believe this and to maintain a sense of self-esteem, he had to   
resort to grossly distorted reconstructions.   
  
Miss Darrow   
  
This leaves only Miss Darrow (the missionary's daughter) whose   
apparent conversion had, when I last saw her, already begun to   
wear off. From occasional correspondence, as well as from contacts   
with people who knew her, I learned that her pattern had continued   
to be very similar to the one she had shown when I interviewed her;   
but since these interviews had taken place in Canada three months   
after her release, they were able — much more clearly than the Hong   
Kong encounters — to indicate long-range tendencies. She was con-   
tinuing her gradual adaptation to Canadian life, and also continu-   
ing her painful and guilt-ridden reality testing. She remained much   
more sympathetic to the Chinese Communist regime than most   
other subjects, but she was able to be increasingly critical of its   
distortion and its oppression. She was indeed realizing her (self-   
fulfilling) prophecy of becoming the "left-wing liberal" — willing to   
co-operate with various groups and individuals interested in study-   
ing thought reform but strongly opposed to right-wing propagan-   
dists exploitation. In her personal and professional life, she im-   
  
  
2o6 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
pressed friends and colleagues with her unusual intelligence and   
perceptiveness. She still suffered from the sense of being the "be-   
trayer" when she was critical of the Chinese Communists, especially   
when she contrasted her change in view with the still uncompromis-   
ingly "reformed" ideas of her male friend. Her older and closer   
female friend had continued to offer much emotional support, and   
an interlude of physical illness had supplied a helpful moratorium;   
but Miss Darrow continued with her step-by-step search, still plagued   
by her ever-present susceptibilities to guilt.   
  
CHAPTER   
  
FATHER SIMON:   
  

----------------------- Page 181-----------------------

THE CONVERTED JESUIT   
  
In the course of my follow-up visits, I was intro-   
duced to a priest who had experienced prison thought   
reform, but who had not been a subject of my original Hong Kong   
study. A French Jesuit, he was teaching science at a small Catholic   
school near the Franco-German border. My interview with him was   
not, strictly speaking, a follow-up visit; but it proved to be an un-   
usually interesting encounter. This Catholic Father, three-and-a-   
half years after his release, was still seeing the world almost entirely   
through "reformed" eyes. He had come closer to a true conversion   
experience than had any of my original subjects.   
  
The interplay between Father Simon and the colleague of his   
(also a subject of mine) who introduced us was a good indication   
of what was to follow. This other priest explained to Simon that   
I had tried to meet him in Hong Kong, but had been told that he   
(Simon) did not wish to see me. Simon irately denied this, insist-   
ing that he had never been approached, and accusing his clerical   
colleagues in Hong Kong of preventing a meeting between us be-   
cause they were embarrassed by his views. (Actually, it is difficult   
to say just who had prevented me from seeing Father Simon in Hong   
Kong; it is quite probable that neither he nor his fellow priests felt   
very enthusiastic about my interviewing him.)   
  
207   
  
208 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
In Europe, however, Simon was clearly interested in talking with   
me. A thin, tense man in his late fifties, he quickly gave me the   
impression that he had a great deal to say about matters which he   
did not feel free to discuss too openly in his present environment.   
Indeed, his first words were pointed expressions of criticism directed   
at fellow priests who published strongly anti-Communist writings   
or presented what were in his opinion distorted views of prison   
thought reform. And when I asked him how he felt about his im-   
prisonment, he answered without hesitation: "It was one of the   
best periods of my life." Then he explained that thought reform   
was valid because it was effective: "People claim that the Com-   
munists tried to introduce false points of view into your brain —   
but this could never work; it is only because they introduced true   
things . . . that it works." He went on to say that, "As for free-   
dom of speech, I had more ... in jail than I have right here,"   
explaining that while he was in prison, "I accepted all of their points   
of view — political and economic, everything," then adding as some-   
thing of an afterthought, "except for a deadlock on the religious   
point of view."   
  
Father Simon wasted no time in making it clear just where he   
stood. I could not help feeling amazement during these first few   
minutes of our interview, as I heard this Jesuit priest express only   

----------------------- Page 182-----------------------

praise for Communism and only criticism for the actions of his   
Catholic colleagues. Although I knew the general principles of   
thought reform, I wondered just how this had been accomplished.   
  
Father Simon was brought up in a hardworking middle-class fam-   
ily in a French provincial town. Since his father owned a small busi-   
ness enterprise, he now felt that "I was born on the wrong side of   
the fence. . . . My education was entirely on the capitalistic side."   
He had learned in prison that "I lived from a salary taken from   
workmen," but defended his parents as having done the best they   
could, limited as they were by "the ideas of their surroundings."   
Simon described the religious influences in his family as very strong:   
two sisters trained as nuns, and two uncles became missionaries. A   
conscientious boy who always "had the feeling that life was some-   
thing serious," he had wished to become a priest from the age of   
eleven, and had made his definite decision when he was fifteen.   
He attributed his religious inclinations to his mother's influence;   
his father — an austere, distant, and highly-respected figure — had   
  
FATHER SIMON: THE CONVERTED JESUIT 209   
  
originally opposed his decision to enter the priesthood. As in the   
case of Father Luca, his mother's intercession helped him to carry   
it through.   
  
He received extensive training in science, philosophy, and theol-   
ogy. This work included three years of study in the United States   
during his early thirties, and it is significant that he returned to   
Europe something of a convert to the American way of life, so   
much so that he sometimes irked his colleagues (several of whom   
I had spoken to) with his expression of his new allegiance, and   
his insistence that French science was nothing compared to ad-   
vanced American developments. He had retained these sentiments   
over the twenty years he spent teaching science in China; but they   
were soon overshadowed by his enormous attachment to China it-   
self. Although a distant and reserved man, he sought always to enter   
deeply into Chinese life. He organized scientific trips during which   
he traveled and camped outdoors with a small group from his uni-   
versity. "For two or three weeks ... I lived entirely among stu-   
dents. ... It made life more human . . . and the students found   
me as a man they did not know before."   
  
In other ways too, he tended to be different from and sometimes   
at odds with his colleagues. One described him as "very independ-   
ent in judgments . . . liked to be against things . . . enthusiasms   
strong but changeable . . . apparently cold, but really passionate."   
  
He was at the same time extremely diligent in his work, and   
utterly conscientious in his religious life. As one friend expressed   
it, "I often broke rules, but Simon never did."   
  
Thus, before his contact with the Communists, he was a man   

----------------------- Page 183-----------------------

strongly susceptible to some forms of environmental influence, and   
at the same time capable of stubbornly resisting others. He possessed   
a powerful conscience and an accompanying susceptibility to guilt,   
both related to early family struggles; and much of Simon's life was   
involved with which influence he should follow as the "good" one,   
and which he should resist as the "bad." In his various experiments   
with identity, however, it was his sense of being the conscientious   
enthusiast which prevailed over each of a number of different en-   
thusiasms.   
  
During the early years of Communist rule, he was proud of being   
the only foreigner permitted to integrate his scientific work with   
the government program. At the same time, he was extremely criti-   
  
210 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
cal of the Communist movement, and strongly opposed the regime's   
attempts to spread its influence within his university. He expected   
to be arrested because he had been accused with others (falsely)   
of using a radio for espionage purposes.   
  
Simon admitted to me that the early period of his imprisonment   
was "hard." But he avoided any mention of specific brutality and   
claimed that he had been deprived of sleep for only one night. He   
preferred to "explain" the Communist approach ("According to   
their method they take advantage of the first shock" ) , and implied   
that their techniques were necessary because he had so extremely   
opposed them at the beginning. I was able to learn some of the   
missing details, however, from another European who had shared   
the same cell with Simon for a while: "Simon had been interrogated   
three days without sleep. They said he hadn't been giving any in-   
formation. The inspector, when alone with him, spat in his face   
ten times." This same informant said that Simon had been un-   
usually stubborn in his resistance: "a daredevil." In both versions,   
however, it was clear that Simon was extremely fearful of being   
shot.   
  
He went then from extreme resistance to complete compliance,   
and his own story makes clear the psychological features of this   
reversal. Even after he no longer feared death, his desire to remain   
in China profoundly influenced his behavior:   
  
I thought that I was one of those with the best chance to stay. I had   
received instructions from my superior to try to stay. I realized that if I   
did not change my mind, I would have no chance at all to stay. I   
decided I would try to see what was right, and if doubtful, I could try   
to adopt the Communist point of view.   
  
Simon was helped along this path by a fellow Jesuit in the same   
cell who taught him how to begin his confession.   
  
But he recognized that his own sense of guilt had played the   

----------------------- Page 184-----------------------

most important part: "My position changed when I said, 'I am   
guilty'." While unconscious guilt was undoubtedly present all along,   
his sense of being criminally guilty developed after about one year,   
and was accompanied by a strong compulsion to confess. "I made   
a list in French ... for my own use of ten points which I should   
never mention. ... Six months later I had told everything. . . .   
I was then ready to tell everything about myself and anyone else."   
  
  
  
FATHER SIMON: THE CONVERTED JESUIT 211   
  
His list had, of course, been his unconscious preparation for what   
was to come. When he made it he decided that "if I put together   
all these faults I had been accused of ... I could say I was guilty."   
  
When I asked him what he had to feel guilty about, he first an-   
swered evasively, "We had plenty of things." And then he did   
describe one of them — an occasion soon after World War II when   
Catholic chaplains from the American Army brought an intelligence   
officer to see Simon and some of his colleagues, "and then we told   
them plenty of things." But, as if realizing that this might not be   
in itself so damning, he added, "What we did any foreigner would   
have done, but we should have been more careful." Then, as if   
to justify further his guilt, he explained that "In jail we didn't ac-   
cuse only our crimes, but rather the intention of our crimes"; he   
went on to describe how he had contemplated (but had never   
carried out) telling an American missionary who was leaving de-   
tails about Communist work on an airfield, realizing that this in-   
formation might be passed on to an official American group.   
  
I had no way of knowing whether this idea had really occurred   
to Simon before his imprisonment, or whether it was a product of   
the guilt-stimulating pressures of imprisonment itself. Either way,   
it was part of his need to find evidence of both wrongdoing and   
wrong-thinking so he could rationalize, in thought reform terms,   
his own psychological state: "Every time I found a crime I had   
committed, I was glad to find it." But among a myriad of trivial   
self-accusations, the encounter with an American intelligence officer   
was undoubtedly a true source of psychological guilt, as it violated   
Simon's deepest sense of what a missionary should do and be.   
  
His guilt established in his own mind, Simon moved on to the   
next step— complete enthusiasm and complete trust:   
  
One of the prisoners suggested writing diaries — only about our change   
of mind. . . . Every day we gave the cell chief our diary. We had the   
feeling we were living in a glass house — but we had no bad feelings at   
all. Our souls were entirely open. It was complete confidence. We could   
trust the government.   
  
Simon's attainment of mutual trust and harmony with the Chi-   

----------------------- Page 185-----------------------

nese realized a long-desired goal, a goal which he felt had before   
this always eluded him: "I never had a good chance to live among   
the Chinese except the last three years in jail." During this period   
  
212 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
he held nothing back from his colleagues and cellmates ("I was   
glad to get rid of all I had on my mind and to speak very frankly"),   
and his statements included extensive denunciations of the behavior   
of many of his colleagues, both in and out of jail.   
  
He was transferred during his last year to a jail where he was   
permitted to do manual labor. His guilt had led to a feeling of   
tranquility: "I was more quiet. I thought I am guilty and deserve   
it." Once he was happy in jail, his main fear was that he would   
soon be released. He knew that jail was a safer place for him than   
life in China on the outside; and contact with his own colleagues in   
Europe seemed least safe of all:   
  
When I was in labor camp during the last year, I was glad to be there.   
I was afraid to be out, because if allowed to stay in China I would have   
much trouble. If I came out, there would be trouble with my Order.   
. . . When I received my sentence, I wrote immediately to the head   
of the court, "I do not ask for a reduction in the sentence, but I would   
like you to cross out the clause about being kicked out of the country."   
  
By this time, he was, more than any of my subjects, identifying   
himself with his reformers. He took pride in bringing others around:   
"There was one fellow we worked on for two full days. At first we   
couldn't get to him . . . but finally we did." Much impressed with   
individual Communists, he set them up as his standard, and always   
compared himself unfavorably to them: "We worked hard — but   
could not beat them. . . . They worked all of the days, and had   
meetings at night. . . . And they were very enthusiastic about their   
work." He could justify in his mind even their curbs upon religion :   
"They said that outside of jail there is religious freedom, inside   
no. . . . That was tough on us, but we had to follow regulations";   
and he was grateful for a slight relaxation in this area: "At the end,   
for instance, I was allowed to say my breviary."   
  
He emphasized that in all this he had become increasingly im-   
pressed with the sincerity of the Communist officials, and illustrated   
this with their attitude toward their false accusation about the   
radio:   
  
At the beginning, I thought that this was a pretext to arrest me. They   
wanted to take over our university and used this as their pretext. Later   
I found they really believed it. They were in good faith. . . . Then   
they dropped it, and they believed me.   
  
FATHER SIMON: THE CONVERTED JESUIT 21 3   
  

----------------------- Page 186-----------------------

Thus he had, during the course of his imprisonment, run the   
gamut from opposition to merger: "When they called me at the   
beginning, it was a fight — at the end it was a chat with a friend."   
  
Simon related this story to me in a simple, straightforward   
manner, impressing me both with his conscientiousness and his   
naivete\ At times he seemed totally unaware of the degree to which   
he had been manipulated. But at other times, I felt that awareness   
of this manipulation — as well as of the inconsistencies of the Com-   
munist position — had intruded upon his consciousness, and that he   
was hard put to fend it off. This inner struggle became more evident   
as he told me of his experiences after his release.   
  
Tense and agitated upon his arrival in Hong Kong, Simon had   
found himself in total disagreement with everyone and everything   
around him. His situation was aggravated by his compulsion to ex-   
press these antagonistic feelings:   
  
I couldn't control myself . . . when I was in jail, I could read   
Chinese newspapers for an entire month with no reaction, but when I   
came out, after every paragraph, I jumped . . . when someone told   
me something I thought was wrong, I had to speak.   
  
At that time, he was convinced that because of his "change of   
ideas" he would not be able to remain in the Jesuit Order: "I don't   
mean I thought I would leave, but that I might be kicked out." He   
thought he might have to become a secular priest (one who be-   
longs to no special order) and "find a bishop who would take me."   
  
His Jesuit colleagues, however, felt differently. Appalled at his   
behavior and attitudes, but for the most part sympathetic to him as   
a person, they were intent upon tiding him over what they con-   
sidered to be a crisis and winning him back to a more acceptable set   
of views. One of them with whom I had talked in Hong Kong had   
even asked my advice about the problem. He had decided — partly   
in response to pressures from other colleagues and partly because of   
his own convictions — to apply to Simon what he called "shock   
therapy." By this he meant confronting him with the disparaging   
material that had been published about him in Chinese Com-   
munist newspapers and magazines, including accusations and con-   
fessions of heterosexual and homosexual behavior. (Simon had been   
accused of committing a "sexual crime" [homosexual act] during his   
imprisonment; although this was probably a false accusation, it   
  
214 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
could well have touched off latent fears and impulses and stimulated   
a good deal of confession material.) Simon's Jesuit friend had   
hesitated to use his "shock" approach because he had noted that   
on the few occasions when he had attempted to bring up the sub-   
ject of prison confessions, Simon had become silent and fearful. I    
felt he had good reason to hesitate, and advised him against the   

----------------------- Page 187-----------------------

"shock therapy." However, influenced by the fact that Simon was   
leaving for Europe in a few days, and believing that others in the   
Church might be less understanding about the whole problem than   
he was, the Jesuit had disregarded my advice and gone ahead with   
his direct but gently-administered confrontation.   
  
He felt at the time that his shock therapy had been effective,   
since Simon had responded with surprise and a certain amount of   
anger directed at the Communists. But like many therapists, shock   
or otherwise, he had been premature in his evaluation; for soon   
Simon overcame his resentment toward the Communists through   
a rationalized analysis of the situation, which he also gave to me:   
  
The Communists have two different departments, justice and propa-   
ganda. Justice wants to know the truth. Propaganda wants to amplify   
everything. . . . For justice, I still have the document of condemna-   
tion . . . based on the true facts. . . . Some expressions are rather   
ambiguous, but what they charged me of, I have admitted. . . . What   
they wrote in the newspapers [for propaganda] is entirely different.   
  
It is possible, however, that this incident did play a part in   
Simon's gradual realization that the Communists were not com-   
pletely truthful:   
  
That's one point on which I have changed a little. Then [when in   
prison] I had the feeling that the Communists never lied. I feel now   
that although there are more lies on the other side, the Communists   
also lie — although they are more clever and more skillful. ... If the   
Communists only told the truth, it would be awful for us.   
  
Despite this small concession, he remained acutely at odds with   
his fellow priests. He looked upon them as "reactionary," and they   
tended to view him as one who had been convinced (and deceived)   
by the Communists because he was "doctrinally unsound" in his   
Catholic theology. One priest used him to illustrate the point that   
it is the "technicians" among Catholic priests who are likely to be   
most affected by thought reform, rather than those who are more   
  
FATHER SIMON: THE CONVERTED JESUIT 21 J   
  
strongly grounded philosophically. Another, who had been de-   
nounced in prison by Simon, referred to the latter's behavior as a   
"twist of conscience. . . . He is a very conscientious man, and when   
he reported against me he was being very conscientious in another   
way."   
  
The Jesuit organization seemed to have more tolerance for his   
point of view than Simon had anticipated; but he felt that in re-   
assigning him to a teaching position, they had expected him even-   
tually to "become normal again." He made a point of expressing his   
Communist sympathies clearly to his superiors, and he finally   
reached a modus vivendi with them in which they accepted his right   

----------------------- Page 188-----------------------

to hold any beliefs he pleased as long as he did not proclaim them   
too loudly to the outside world. He accepted this restriction as part   
of the principle (emphasized by both the Communists and the   
Catholics) that an individual priest cannot separate his actions from   
his responsibilities to his order; at the same time he indicated that   
he would like to express his views publicly through writing or speak-   
ing "if I were free."   
  
He was— emotionally and intellectually — much more distant from   
his colleagues than before. He had always viewed himself as "rather   
cold toward other people," and this isolation was increased "because   
I live with people who don't share the same idea." When I asked   
him if he had been influenced by any of his colleagues since his   
return, he replied, "There couldn't be much influence because their   
ideas are so contradictory to mine."   
  
He was so much alone with his thoughts that his only oppor-   
tunities to express himself came during long automobile trips he   
made to preach in outlying areas. These trips were arranged by a   
local organization, and on them he found release in talking to the   
driver, usually a businessman volunteer: "I know they don't share   
my opinions, but it is very enjoyable for me." Sometimes his com-   
panion, when he first heard that Simon had been through interest-   
ing experiences in China, would enthusiastically invite him to speak   
before a local club — to which Simon would reply, "Let us talk   
together for a few more minutes and then see whether you still wish   
me to speak before your group." The invitation was never repeated.   
Simon concluded that "they don't want their members to hear that   
kind of stuff."   
  
Toward the end of our three-hour talk, he described to me his   
  
2l6 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
attempts to achieve an inner synthesis between his older Catholic   
and newer Communist ideologies. He claimed that this attempt   
had begun even before he was imprisoned, when he had envisioned   
a political party "entirely Communist but with Christian prin-   
ciples" (although at the time he supported his fellow priests against   
the encroachments of the Communist regime). Like other priests   
among my subjects, he felt that he had reinforced his own spiritual   
life through his imprisonment: "The fact of feeling guilty is good   
Christian humility." But unlike the others, he believed that the   
Communists themselves possessed the Christian virtues ("I feel   
that most of the Communists are humble"), a strong expression of   
praise from a Catholic priest.   
  
He claimed that through his experience he felt himself closer to   
the Catholic religion "because, in one way I am nearer the truth."   
His facial expression became animated and enthusiastic as he de-   
scribed to me the way in which he had improved his inner life:   
  

----------------------- Page 189-----------------------

I have had more experience with introspection. With all of the methods   
of criticism we go very deep into the subconscious. I remember in jail   
. . . everyone told their faults against the discipline, then we decided   
to get deep into the reasons. Then others would say, "This and this is   
the reason." We would say, "No, no, no — that's not it." Then at night   
you would think they are right, and as soon as you realized this, the   
fault was corrected at once. . . . This is very important for the re-   
ligious life. ... A very powerful tool.   
  
I felt his alternation in this statement between first person sin-   
gular and plural, and the second and third persons, was more than   
a matter of a European speaking English (his English was, in fact,   
fluent), and really reflected his alternating images of himself as a   
member of the Communist-oriented group, as the target of its   
criticism, and as a spiritually-active European Catholic. He in fact   
emphasized that it was not possible to use this kind of group   
criticism in his present circumstances, and that he was forced to   
apply this "tool" himself — and so, in effect, assume simultaneously   
all three identities. He believed that Communism and Catholicism   
should maintain their interchange of techniques and that Catholi-   
cism should seek to benefit from the Communist improvements   
"Lenin borrowed many things from religious orders, but amplified   
them a lot. ... If we can get them back from Lenin, that is all   
right."   
  
FATHER SIMON". THE CONVERTED JESUIT 217   
  
Yet he could not avoid recognizing his inevitable conflict, as a   
Catholic priest, with the Communist creed. When I asked, for in-   
stance, if he were troubled by the problem of materialism — a point   
of bitter controversy, at least theoretically, between Communism   
and Catholicism — he replied, "No, but it means I can never be a   
Communist," and went on to say:   
  
My conflict with the Communists came when I said, "For me religion   
is first, Communism is second." If I had been able to write a blank   
check and say that anything the Communists do about religion is OK,   
then I could have stayed. That much I could not have done. ... I   
trusted them very much, but not that much. ... If not for this prob-   
lem of religion I would have followed the Communist Party entirely,   
without any restriction.   
  
He added that during his last month in jail he wondered, "Do I   
not go too far?" and then decided, "I shall never have an uncondi-   
tional surrender. I shall never sign a blank check." Now he con-   
cluded, not without some sadness, that because of this unwilling-   
ness, "for the Communists I am still an enemy . . . since if you   
don't accept them entirely, they consider you an enemy."   
  
When I asked him whether he would consider such a black-and-   
white judgment on the part of the Communists to be at all unfair,   
his answer was what could be expected — but its implications were   

----------------------- Page 190-----------------------

nonetheless striking:   
  
No. To understand Communism you must compare it with Catholic   
belief. If with Catholic belief, you don't accept one article of faith, you   
are not a Catholic. If you don't sign a blank check, you are not a   
Catholic.   
  
Simon had no objection to the demand itself. When I asked him   
whether he was willing to make this "unconditional surrender" to   
Catholicism, he replied:   
  
Of course. ... I like Communism and Catholicism, but Catholicism   
always comes first. In case of conflict, I will stay with Catholicism.   
  
World politics were, of course, another matter. As far as Com-   
munist activities in general were concerned, Simon said, "I am not   
even against a revolution — of course as mild as possible, but you   
cannot always do anything about that." And about the return of   
  
2l8 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
General de Gaulle to power during 1958, he offered a remarkably   
candid opinion:   
  
Well, give him a chance. See what he can do. I was rather against him   
at first because I thought he was reactionary. Then someone said that   
Moscow was not against him because they thought he would break   
NATO. Since then I have not been so much against him because Mos-   
cow had that opinion. If Moscow stands for de Gaulle, then I am for   
de Gaulle.   
  
But in discussing thought reform, he made a statement far more   
significant than he realized:   
  
The way you look at it depends upon whether you feel that their opin-   
ions are true or false. If you say they are false, then it is all brainwashing   
stuff. If you think them true, they help you. I saw cases of serious   
offences — even some real crimes — completely changed. . . . With the   
habit of introspection you can very quickly see whether someone is tell-   
ing the truth.   
  
Here Simon, quite unintentionally, let his inner doubts out of   
the bag, implying with this slip that he and others like him were   
not guilty of "real crimes," but of something else that must be dis-   
tinguished from them.   
  
He ended the interview — just as he began it — with praise for the   
"very powerful" and "wonderful" thought reform methods, and   
denunciation of those Catholic priests who he felt had presented   
distorted views of Communist China.   
  
Why did Father Simon go so far that his conversion strains the   

----------------------- Page 191-----------------------

meaning of apparent? It is interesting to compare him with our   
other apparent convert, Miss Darrow. The two are very different   
kinds of people; and yet there are striking similarities in their emo-   
tional reactions. Both responded very strongly to the opportunity   
to merge with the Chinese people; both experienced an unusually   
strong sense of guilt, and a strong need to be absolutely sincere   
with their captors; both eventually achieved a greater harmony   
with their prison environment than with any they had previously   
known, and were loath to surrender it for the anticipated pain of   
"freedom." This authoritarian priest shared with the liberal mis-   
sionary's daughter psychological traits characteristic for the ap-   
parent convert: strong susceptibility to guilt, confusion of identity,   
  
FATHER SIMON: THE CONVERTED JESUIT 210.   
  
and most important of all, a long-standing pattern of totalism.   
  
Simon's totalism had in fact always been much more prominent   
than, Miss Darrow's. As the conscientious enthusiast, he had shown   
a tendency to embrace totally a series of influences — Catholicism,   
American know-how, Chinese life, and then Chinese Communism.   
Unlike Miss Darrow, he had not rebelled from the religious in-   
fluences which helped to shape this totalism during his early life.   
He did not seek a liberal alternative; rather, in his "unconditional   
surrender" to Catholicism he was attracted toward the most au-   
thoritarian and uncompromising elements within a many-sided (but   
always potentially authoritarian) ideology.   
  
But within his identity of conscientious enthusiast were two   
vying elements, the convert and the defier. As the former, he sought,   
and as the latter feared, total unity with an all-powerful force. He   
required a pattern of defiance in order to ward off the strong attrac-   
tions to continuous influences around him. Sometimes he would   
defy one first and convert to it later, sometimes convert to it first   
and then defy it; or on still other occasions, defy one strong in-   
fluence while converting to another. Thus he defied his father to   
convert to the priesthood (it would be interesting to know whether   
he had originally been at all defiant in his attitude toward religion),   
defied French influence in his conversion to America and Western   
influence in his conversion to China, defied both Catholic and   
American influences in his conversion to Communism, and then   
continued to defy Catholic pressures as a means of maintaining   
this conversion. Whether defying or converting, his was an all-or-   
none approach. This is symbolized in his repeated use of the term   
"blank check": for one who issues a "blank check" to another may   
be offering either everything or nothing, without specifying how   
much of himself he gives and how much he insists upon retaining.   
  
As a conscientious Catholic priest and scientist, his total dedica-   
tion to missionary work, credal purity, truthfulness, and sincerity   
were basic to his affirmative self-image. But both the defier and the   
convert within him could interfere and become part of his negative   

----------------------- Page 192-----------------------

identity; for underneath both of them was a profound inability to   
trust or to become intimate with other human beings. Each con-   
version was a quest for the trust and intimacy that had long eluded   
him; unable to experience them in ordinary human doses, he sought   
trust and intimacy on absolute terms. For him, both conversion and   
  
220 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
defiance were attempts to ward off inner feelings of aloneness,   
weakness, and helplessness.   
  
In prison, he was first the defier (an unusually courageous one),   
and then the convert (an unusually loyal one). In both identities,   
his conscientiousness was outstanding; but his behavior also re-   
vealed the basic contradiction within his convert-defier pattern. His   
ideal of "unconditional surrender" was not fully attainable. He   
could not, after all, sign the "blank check." He tells us that this   
was because he could not submit simultaneously and totally to two   
masters; and this is true enough. But it is also true that he could   
not — either then or before — submit totally to any master. Ulti-   
mately, the "unconditional surrender" and the "blank check" were   
unrealizable ideals, as they so often are for those who seek them.   
For Simon, they had been an inspiring myth; but defiance, doubt,   
and mistrust eventually interfered in relation to both Catholicism   
and Communism.   
  
In his post-prison years, Simon — despite his outward assurance —   
was inwardly walking an emotional tightrope. Whatever his denials,   
he did continue to serve two emotional masters, and this is a con-   
siderable strain. Even more subject to totalism than Miss Darrow,   
he remained truer than she to his thought reform conversion.   
Three-and-a-half years after his release he was still unable to come   
to terms with the actualities of his experience: he felt the need to   
reconstruct thought reform events to make them more congenial   
and less brutal, and to emphasize his compliance rather than his   
resistance. He had to avoid the recognition of having been manipu-   
lated, or else minimize the manipulation and justify its usage.   
  
Obviously all was not well with this last — and perhaps most   
profound — of Simon's conversions. He was not, after all, immune   
from the Catholic influences around him, nor from the forces of   
reality testing, nor from the voice of his own doubts. Evidence for   
this lies in his slightly more critical (though hardly very critical)   
attitude toward Communism, in his slips of the tongue, in his over-   
stated protestations. As with all true believers, his doubts were not   
easy to tolerate, since unconsciously he tended to see them as a   
lack of total sincerity on his part. Yet his doubts were constantly   
stimulated by the presence of his other (Catholic) master — that is,   
by Church officials and Catholic ideas. This accounts for some of the   
vehemence with which he criticized his fellow clergymen; he was   
  
FATHER SIMON: THE CONVERTED JESUIT 221   

----------------------- Page 193-----------------------

  
calling his defiant self into play in order to purge the doubts which   
threatened to "betray" his thought reform experience, and conse-   
quently overstating his praise for Communism.   
  
It may be that in the long run he, too, will backslide. But the   
tenacity with which this Jesuit priest had held on to his Chinese   
Communist conversion was as impressive a reform result as any I   
witnessed, particularly since there was no environmental reinforce-   
ment for his thought reform views. To be sure, the unanimity of   
his colleagues' opposition served as a stimulus to his defiance of   
them; and some reinforcement was available, even if from a dis-   
tance, in the constant information about the Communist world   
reaching him through newspapers, magazines, and casual conversa-   
tions. But even after all of this has been said, Father Simon's case   
leaves one with a renewed respect for the emotional power of   
thought reform.   
  
CHAPTER   
  
RECOVERY AND RENEWAL:   
A SUMMING UP   
  
We have described in the last two chapters the   
emotional trials of Westerners during their first few   
post-thought reform years. These were never easy, and they took   
many different personal forms, but the common pattern was one   
of recovery and renewal. There were certain basic tasks which they   
all faced, psychological principles to which they were all subject.   
Their common problems were mainly the result of the thought re-   
form emotions they had shared; but they were also related to an-   
other heritage common to all these men, that of the Westerner   
in China.   
  
Mastery and Integrity   
  
When the Westerners returned home, typically they found them-   
selves compelled to be active, preoccupied with thought reform in   
particular and with China in general, and unable to become im-   
mediately interested in their Western environments. It was as if   
they had some piece of psychological business to attend to before   
they could permit themselves the luxury of rest or could assume the   
responsibility of new involvements. This unrest represented the   
psychological need to re-enact a highly disturbing experience, and   
  
222   
  
RECOVERY AND RENEWAL 223   
  
is related to what Freud called the "repetition compulsion." 1 It is   
an effort at mastery in which, as Erikson has described, "The in-   
dividual unconsciously arranges for variations of an original theme   

----------------------- Page 194-----------------------

which he has not learned either to overcome or to live with," and   
deals with the stressful situation by "meeting it repeatedly and of   
his own accord." 2   
  
As is also true of people put through many other kinds of painful   
experiences, these subjects were reliving their thought reform as a   
means of coming to terms with it. Their experience involved spe-   
cial emphasis upon problems of shame and guilt, and it was these   
emotions which they had in some measure to overcome. Otherwise   
they would be unable either to overcome or to live with their   
thought reform, and unable to recover their self-esteem. We may   
therefore describe their psychological task as mastery through res-   
toration of integrity.   
  
Lecturing and writing about thought reform were particularly   
effective ways of achieving this mastery. By these acts the subject   
was in effect saying: "I am no longer the passive, helpless criminal   
and betrayer. I am an active, strong authority on a manipulative   
process which could affect any of you in my audience or reading   
public." Such retelling is the former prisoner's means of declaring   
his identity shift, his beginning disengagement from his own ex-   
perience.   
  
However, after any great adventure, or even a commonplace oc-   
currence, the reconstruction can never reproduce exactly the ex-   
perience itself. The changed inner and outer circumstances and the   
passage of time must induce distortions. Truth is at best an ap-   
proximation, and for these men the need for altered reconstruction   
is likely to be great. The direction and the degree of distortion   
depended upon the Westerner's way of responding to thought re-   
form, his developing relationship with his new environment, and his   
long-standing psychological techniques for dealing with threats to   
his sense of integrity.   
  
Bishop Barker's reconstruction, for instance, was the story of a   
clever and heroic man who made no concessions and who out-   
witted his reformers at every turn. I said of him that he had ex-   
tended his use of the mechanism of denial to the point of con-   
fabulation, because I knew that his reconstruction was inaccurate   
both in terms of actual events and attitudes towards those events.   
  
224 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
Such a distortion in self-representation was characteristic for ap-   
parent resisters: in order to maintain a sense of integrity, over the   
years they would build upon the heroic self-image, and "forget"   
events and emotions associated with their having been weak or   
deceived. While Bishop Barker was by no means completely free of   
inner doubts about his heroic self-image, he had been able to   
master the thought reform experience sufficiently to carry through   
his distortion rather effectively.   
  

----------------------- Page 195-----------------------

But there were apparent resisters to whom these patterns of   
denial and repression were dangerous. Another priest whom I saw   
in follow-up (he was not mentioned earlier) had, like Bishop Barker   
used denial and repression to reinforce the heroic image which   
others were ready to confer upon him. He too gave many crusading   
speeches, and impressed both his audiences and his colleagues with   
his strength, energy, and stature. Yet when I saw him, I noticed   
that his eyes expressed fear and agitation. His gaze resembled the   
"thousand-mile stare" characteristic of prisoners immediately after   
their release — and he was the only one of my subjects who looked   
this way three years later. For almost two hours this priest de-   
scribed his flawless adjustment to European life, denied emotional   
difficulties of any kind, and spoke of the enthusiasm which he was   
able to arouse during his lectures on thought reform. Then, in a   
suddenly lowered voice, he made this admission:   
  
But one thing was strange. . . . For months after I came out, each   
time I saw a stairway in a house, I thought, "What a wonderful place   
to jump ... to commit suicide."   
  
Underneath the show of strength he was a deeply troubled man   
who could not fully believe his own self-representation. His obses-   
sive thoughts of suicide and his outer signs of fear revealed under-   
lying patterns of depression and anxiety. His efforts at mastery   
could not still his inner self-accusations, and his need to idealize   
his behavior prevented him from coming to terms with his strong   
feelings of guilt. Although he demonstrated strength and effective-   
ness in many areas, he was having great difficulty restoring his   
sense of integrity.   
  
Father Simon made use of similar mechanisms, but his distor-   
tions were in the opposite direction. His need was to justify his   
conversion to Communism and live up to his identity of the con-   
  
RECOVERY AND RENEWAL 225   
  
scientious enthusiast. This involved denial of brutality during his   
imprisonment, repression of antagonisms toward the Communists   
and of recent doubts, and rationalization to justify and explain   
Communist behavior. Like all apparent converts, his sense of in-   
tegrity required that he idealize the Communists and deprecate   
himself, and he reconstructed, in this light, not only his prison   
experience, but his entire life history. The identity of the apparent   
convert (and this was true of Miss Darrow as well) puts one in a   
masochistic stance, the paradoxical situation of being able to main-   
tain self-esteem only by continuous self-flagellation.   
  
The same thing was true of Father Benet. Although he had run   
the gamut from apparent convert to apparent resister, his ap-   
proach to mastery required that he continually focus upon thought   
reform's capacity to humiliate and to make men betray themselves.   
His distortion was in the direction of exaggerating both thought   

----------------------- Page 196-----------------------

reform's power and the human weakness of those put through it.   
This "analysis" was partly a reflection of his own experience, and   
partly a means of restating the sado-masochistic self-representation   
which he needed for his sense of integrity.   
  
Father Vechten required a serious "accident" to interrupt his   
compensatory overactivity and permit him the opportunity to deal   
with his inner conflicts. As one of the obviously confused, he had   
not resorted to the gross distortions which were characteristic for   
(although by no means limited to) apparent resisters and apparent   
converts. He in fact went to the opposite extreme, and his inability   
to permit himself the slightest amount of poetic license was a   
large factor in his difficulties. His approach to integrity demanded   
that he spare no details of his own "misbehavior" in his reconstruc-   
tion; on the other hand, his intensified shame and guilt, and his   
fear of not finding acceptance within his European Catholic en-   
vironment, prevented him from sharing this accurate version with   
his colleagues and as a result, he had no way to express his inner   
preoccupations. His integrity could not be restored until the "ac-   
cident" broke this impasse.   
  
The struggle for mastery is most intense immediately following   
thought reform, and during the first weeks and months after re-   
lease emotional crises center around it. In most of my Western   
subjects, it tended to subside a great deal after a year, as distance   
and perspective were gradually achieved, and the Westerners be-   
  
226 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
came able to formulate an explanation of their behavior. This re-   
construction is the subject's new psychological truth, his means of   
coming to terms with both his thought reform and his Western   
environment. A subject was likely to have difficulty with his re-   
construction when it was so distorted that he found it hard to sup-   
port his own belief in it, or when it was so literal and unsparing   
that he was unable to express it. In any event, each subject's   
struggle for mastery probably will continue indefinitely, whether   
or not he is consciously aware of the struggle.   
  
Separation   
  
A second major emotional conflict for these men and women   
was the problem of separation. At first I was surprised when West-   
ern subjects, almost without exception, put as much emphasis on   
their sadness at being separated from China as on their conflicts over   
thought reform, and wondered if their doing so was a means of avoid-   
ing more disturbing emotions. This was the situation to some extent   
in a few; but the continued longing for China which most of them   
expressed years later convinced me that separation was a profound   
problem in itself. They were clearly experiencing a "grief" reaction.   
But what were they mourning?   
  

----------------------- Page 197-----------------------

Some were mourning the loss of the very special intimacy of the   
thought reform group — the delight in total exposure and sharing.   
As was true of Dr. Vincent, this delight can be keenly felt if one   
has never before known it; and Father Simon still retained the   
effects of this loss years later. Others, like Father Emile, mourned   
for those (in his case, Chinese Catholic priests) who were left be-   
hind to suffer. As a Western missionary, he felt that because he   
had helped introduce the alien religion now being persecuted, he was   
responsible for the suffering. This emotion is not unlike that of a   
man who has lost a wife, parent, or, perhaps more appropriately,   
brother or son by death; he remembers all the ways in which he had   
caused his loved one suffering, to the point where (at least uncon-   
sciously) he feels he is responsible for the death itself. This type of   
reaction is intensified by any pre-existing hostility which the   
mourner might have had for the mourned, since this makes the   
assumption of a sense of responsibility for the death or suffering   
all the easier.   
  
RECOVERY AND RENEWAL 227   
  
Others among my subjects — Father Luca is a notable example —   
suffered from the realization that they were being separated per-   
manently from their life in China. They would have no more con-   
tact with the special combination of human beings and landscape   
which had nourished them during important adult years. This more   
generalized grief at separation from China includes and transcends   
the first two reactions. In fact, the fear of separation, and the   
anticipated grief could render a prisoner susceptible to thought   
reform, as was clearly true of Father Simon. When this separation   
does occur, finally and irrevocably, the Westerner must experience   
true mourning: he temporarily intensifies his identification with   
China, preoccupies himself with reminders of his past existence   
there, and then bit-by-bit works through the process of detaching   
himself from what has been lost. 3   
  
All these Westerners mourned the loss of something which in-   
volved their most profound emotions; we may say that each   
mourned a lost part of himself. Moreover, this symbolic splitting of   
identity was forced upon these men under the most dishonorable   
conditions: they were expelled from China as criminals and spies.   
This separation with dishonor at the same time robbed them of   
that part of their identities they most treasured, and imposed on   
them the shameful and guilt-laden thought reform elements.   
  
The problem of separation becomes most acute when a West-   
erner arrives in Europe or America: at that time he becomes aware   
of having been totally removed from the Chinese environment. He   
will then seek to return to a Chinese environment, or to main-   
tain contact with others who are in one, in order to recapture what   
has been lost of himself, to reverse the separation process. Much   
depends, of course, upon the degree of involvement with China;   
but among my subjects, there were few for whom the problem of   

----------------------- Page 198-----------------------

separation is not a lingering source of pain.   
  
Expatriates Return   
  
The return to Europe or America confronts the Westerner with   
still another difficult psychological issue, that of the expatriate's   
return. (None was literally an expatriate; the term is used here   
symbolically.) Long residence in China had created in many of   
them a sense of alienation from their own countries, an alienation   
  
228 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
which thought reform greatly intensified; and almost all felt them-   
selves emotionally removed from those around them who had not   
shared their Chinese experiences. They themselves created and   
perpetuated this emotional distance, partly because of their need for   
a personal moratorium which would help them solve problems of   
mastery and separation. This moratorium also allowed them to   
postpone their confrontation with the Western milieu.   
  
Most of my subjects found the Western world strange and hard   
to get used to. And indeed, for those who had been in China for   
several decades, the changes that had occurred in the Western en-   
vironment during that time, as well as in its people, must have   
been striking. Yet the problem was not so much strangeness as it   
was familiarity. Father Vechten's visit to Rome (the center and   
the spiritual patria for all Catholic priests) confronted him with   
beliefs, behavioral codes, and a world view which had always been   
part of him, but which had, during his years in China — and espe-   
cially during his imprisonment — become in some ways modified,   
combined with other influences, and less clearly present in his   
moment-to-moment consciousness. This confrontation did not have   
the effect of something new; rather, he felt an uneasy revival within   
him of a "way of thinking and judging . . . more that which I had   
formerly." The same kind of revival also occurred, usually in a more   
insidious fashion, with all of my Western subjects, whether in mat-   
ters religious, cultural, or specifically personal.   
  
The expatriate's return then is a confrontation with elements of   
one's identity which one has long denied, repressed, or modified be-   
yond easy recognition. The Westerners had originally become ex-   
patriates only in relation to their own identity: the emotions which   
led them to choose careers in China included a need to deny or   
repress, at least temporarily, portions of their heritage in the search   
for a newer synthesis. Each man's early self had been further un-   
dermined by the imposed judgments of thought reform. Back   
home, they were brought in contact — sometimes critically, some-   
times with psychological sensitivity, but always with full impact —   
with these archaic parts of themselves, reminded of them by the   
physical surroundings they encountered and by the people they   
met. Having to face their roots in this manner was both nourish-   
ing and disturbing: they could feel strengthened by being brought   

----------------------- Page 199-----------------------

back to what they had been, and at the same time feel threatened   
  
RECOVERY AND RENEWAL 229   
  
by partisan and provincial emotions and ideas which they thought   
they had long discarded in their cosmopolitan existence. This ex-   
perience of outward journey and inward return is not characteristic   
only of the temporary exile or expatriate; it occurs with anyone   
who risks the slightest deviation from the life patterns originally   
assigned him. 4 For these subjects, either their years of work in   
China or the thought reform experience alone would have made   
this problem a profound one. Together, the two exposures produced   
one of the most difficult forms of expatriate's return imaginable.   
  
Renewal of Identity   
  
The overriding task for these men — a task which included and   
went beyond problems of mastery, separation, and return — was that   
of renewal of identity. To renew, one must look to what has gone   
before; and it was no accident that so many of these men ap-   
proached the problem historically, in both a personal and a broader   
sense.   
  
Sometimes, as in the case of Mr. Kallmann, this historical orienta-   
tion led to a good deal of confusion: unable to trust sufficiently any   
one among many identity elements, he clung tenaciously and some-   
what uncritically to a number of antithetical sides of himself, re-   
lating to Communism and anti-Communism, Nazism and anti-   
Nazism, authoritarian and libertarian emotions, China and the   
West, and a general sense of being "all things to all men" in   
mediating among men. In other cases the historical search had a   
careful, almost academic pattern, although no less emotionally in-   
volved: when Father Luca, for example, studied the life of a great   
modern missionary, he was also immersing himself in the historical   
problems of all Western missionaries in China. To understand this   
process of renewal, we must make a brief excursion into some of   
these historical aspects of the identity of the Westerner in China.   
  
We may begin with the most painful of Western identities —   
that of the imperialist. The Communists built a highly personalized   
image around this term; a non-Communist Westerner was per se   
an "imperialist" (one spoke in prison of "the People" and "the   
Imperialists"); he was greedy, demanding, intrusive, and unscru-   
pulous; he sought to further his own interests by taking from   
  
23O THOUGHT REFORM   
  
others what was rightfully theirs. And only a Westerner could be an   
imperialist; Chinese might be "bourgeois" or "reactionary"— even   
"lackeys" of the imperialists — but never imperialists themselves. In   
ideological terms derived from Lenin's theory of imperialism, they   
considered the imperialist the agent of military, political, economic,   

----------------------- Page 200-----------------------

and cultural subversion, and the destroyer of all that was good and   
noble in Chinese civilization.   
  
The Westerners who had this version of the imperialist identity   
drummed into them during imprisonment began to dislodge them-   
selves from it during the years after release; but each remained   
troubled by the kernel of truth around which the identity is built.   
It is mainly to decide how much of this guilt they should personally   
assume that so many of them made investigations of what the West-   
erner in China had really been. Each discovered what he had al-   
ready known, that the heritage was mixed: schools and gunboats,   
industrial techniques and exploitation, enlightenment and dog-   
matism.   
  
At best, Chinese attitudes toward Westerners have always been   
ambivalent. They have always viewed Westerners with an ethno-   
centric eye, and during four centuries of contact there have been   
periodic waves of persecution and anti-foreign outbreaks. Many   
times before, they have accused the foreigner (with his strange,   
non-Confucian doctrines) of being dangerous and "subversive."   
Conflicts magnified during the latter part of the nineteenth and the   
early part of the twentieth centuries, the era of the West's most   
vigorous military penetration of China. Then all individual West-   
erners became party to the special arrangements and privileges of   
the "unequal treaties" so much resented by the Chinese. This was   
as true for the missionaries as for anyone else — perhaps even truer   
for them because of their influence on Chinese subjects:   
  
. . . the treaties placed not only the missionaries but Chinese Chris-   
tians under the aegis of the foreign powers. . . . The provision . . .   
tended to remove Chinese Christians from the jurisdiction of their   
government and to make of Christian communities imperia in imperio,   
widely scattered enclaves under the defense of aliens. . . . The Church   
had become a partner in Western imperialism and could not well dis-   
avow some responsibility for the consequences. 6   
  
These are not the words of Chinese Communists, but the well-   
considered opinions of Kenneth Latourette, a distinguished Ameri-   
  
RECOVERY AND RENEWAL 231   
  
can historian of China, and himself part of the Protestant mission-   
ary movement.   
  
Some missionaries welcomed this "partnership" with imperialism,   
viewing the military operations and treaties which followed as   
"God's way of opening up the country to his servants." 8 But an   
increasing number of both Catholics and Protestants came to re-   
gard the situation as not only highly "un-Christian" but potentially   
dangerous. In terms of identity, these two groups may be divided   
roughly into pure proselytizers and spiritual mediators; one of these   
two patterns predominated in every Western missionary who came   

----------------------- Page 201-----------------------

to the Middle Kingdom from the sixteenth to the twentieth cen-   
turies.   
  
The spiritual mediator approached China with respect for (or at   
least recognition of) its traditions; he sought to establish common   
cultural ground, so that Chinese could become Christians and still   
retain their identity as Chinese. The missionary himself also had to   
undergo some shift in his own identity before he could move to-   
ward this common ground. Matteo Ricci (1552-1610), one of the   
first and greatest of Catholic missionaries in China and a spiritual   
mediator par excellence, found that the best way to approach the   
Chinese was through the literati, and the best way to approach the   
literati was to blend with the Chinese scene — to become proficient   
in the Chinese language, wear the clothes of a mandarin, adopt   
completely the complex honorifics of literati speech and writing. He   
gained the respect of his hosts by demonstrating his scholarship,   
and by teaching them the latest (Renaissance) Western ideas in   
mathematics, natural sciences, astronomy, and geography. But even   
in this teaching he and his colleagues were careful to make con-   
cessions to Chinese ethnocentricity: on a map of the world which   
they prepared, China was located at the center — it was hard enough   
for the Chinese to accept the idea that great geographical and   
cultural areas existed at all among the "barbarians" outside the   
Chinese sphere.   
  
Ricci went further: he made a detailed study of classical Chinese   
philosophical texts, finding much to admire in Confucian beliefs,   
and always stressing whatever similarities he could find between the   
words of the Sage and the Christian doctrine. He made a special   
point of his conviction that a man could embrace the beliefs and   
customs of both without doing injustice to either. Ricci and his   
colleagues were known as "preaching literati." Their early Jesuit   
  
232 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
successors became important figures at court; some of them were   
given titles as scholar-officials, and received financial and moral   
support from the Emperor himself. Their learning, and especially   
their cultural flexibility, carried them far. As one historian has put   
it, "The Jesuits largely fulfilled traditional Chinese expectations as   
to the likely course of intelligent barbarians in Chinese society."   
They were "culturally conciliatory" and quick to realize that in the   
stable and self-confident Chinese society of that day, "they would   
receive a hearing more or less as candidates for membership or not   
at all." 7   
  
Not all Catholic missionaries approached China with such a   
light touch. The early Franciscans and Dominicans were contem-   
poraries of the Jesuits, and they — rather than Renaissance-influenced   
scholars — were the "simple friars" 8 who brought with them to   
China attitudes of purified medieval Christianity. They were pure   
proselytizers; and their approach to missionary work was "going   

----------------------- Page 202-----------------------

headlong at it." Thus, in 1579, a Franciscan expedition on its way   
to Japan "took possession of China in the name of Christ by offer-   
ing mass on the 24th of June in Canton." '   
  
The Jesuits were cautious about displaying the crucifix because   
they realized that it "horrified" many Chinese; but the Franciscans,   
in their evangelizing, would "march openly through the streets   
dressed in their outlandish habit, cross in hand." 10 Similarly, one   
Dominican "set about overthrowing idols wherever he could lay   
his hands on them" until "the Mandarins . . . laid their hands on   
him and he was speedily ejected." 11 A great Dominican hero of   
this period was Francis Capellas who, during a persecution, was   
taken into custody and put to death. Before achieving martyrdom,   
he is reported to have said: "I have no other house than the wide   
world, no other bed than the ground, no other food than what   
Providence provides from day to day, and no occupation other   
than that of laboring and suffering for the glory of Jesus Christ and   
the eternal happiness of those who believe in Him." His death was   
witnessed by some of his own recently arrived Dominican col-   
leagues, and its news was received in Spanish Catholic circles   
throughout the world "not . . . with mourning but with great   
  
joy" 12    
  
Conflict between spiritual mediators and pure proselytizers soon   
developed. The Jesuits were appalled by what they considered the   
  
RECOVERY AND RENEWAL 233   
  
crude approach of the Dominicans, and feared that it would en-   
danger their own patiently constructed accomplishments. The   
Dominicans — at least many of them — regarded the Jesuits as too   
loose in their methods and too tolerant toward paganism, and as   
threats to the purity of Christianity. Their battle was the celebrated   
"Rites Controversy" of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth   
centuries, fought over the question of how much of customary   
Chinese practice the Christian convert could be permitted to re-   
tain. The Jesuits favored Ricci's approach of conveying the Chris-   
tian concept of God through the use of the classical Chinese terms   
for "Heaven" (T'ien and Shang Ti), claiming that these words   
originally had a theistic significance, and were in any case necessary   
to explain the new faith in a familiar idiom. The Dominicans held   
that these Chinese terms connoted a material heaven or sky; that   
much "superstition" had grown up around them in the Chinese   
mind; and that therefore they should not be used.   
  
Again following Ricci, the Jesuits favored allowing Chinese   
Christians to continue to honor Confucius and their ancestors, on   
the ground that these observances were a tradition of the Chinese   
empire, with a civil rather than a religious significance. The Do-   
minicans considered the observances "pagan" and "superstitious,"   
and therefore not permissible. The Dominican position was upheld

by Papal decrees in 1704, 1710, 1715, and 1742, much to the detri-   
ment of Catholic missionary efforts. The decision injured Chinese   
sensibilities in a variety of ways — the Emperor K'ang Hsi had ex-   
pressed his support of the Jesuit position, and felt that the Pope   
was contesting his authority — and a century of persecutions fol-   
lowed. These persecutions had complex causes and were by no   
means simply a result of the Rites Controversy: but the outcome   
of this controversy and the events which followed were in psy-   
chological and cultural senses, a major triumph for purist, ex-   
tremist forces — and a major defeat for the mediators on both sides.   
Not until 1939, 235 years after the initial decree, did Rome finally   
reverse its decision.   
  
Much more can be said about the political, religious, and cul-   
tural issues of the Rites Controversy; but this outline is enough to   
indicate the importance of these two conflicting identity stances   
for the Westerner in China, and for relations in general between   
China and the West. 13 The examples cited were from early Catholic   
  
234 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
experience, but these two identities were equally present in later   
Protestant missionaries: the pure proselytizers were the Funda-   
mentalist preachers who with their message of hellfire and brim-   
stone had little regard for Chinese cultural traditions; the spiritual   
mediators were those more liberal and socially-oriented missionaries   
who tried to understand and to enter into Chinese life while build-   
ing their churches, universities, and hospitals.   
  
Even secular Western residents — businessmen, diplomats, non-   
missionary teachers, students, and free-lance Sinophiles — were not   
entirely free from this dilemma. They had not come to China to   
propagate Christianity, but they too had the problem of how   
much of the West to sell to the Chinese (or at least to hold onto   
themselves) versus how "Chinese" to become. The treaty-port   
businessman, that prototype of the "old China hand," could be   
something of a proselytizer of Western business methods; or he   
could relax comfortably into his surroundings, accepting his priv-   
ileged position as his due, and regarding the Chinese around him   
with "patronizing affection." 14 The true spiritual expatriates were   
the "Peking Men," a unique group of scholars, writers, and as-   
sorted individualists so thoroughly absorbed by China (even if they   
lived in its past glory) that the rest of the world seemed to them   
virtually uninhabitable, and everything after Peking anticlimactic.   
Those among the Peking Men who had the special subidentity of   
the "China-born" often (like Miss Darrow) struggled hard in their   
adult lives to establish an intimacy with China which they felt had   
been denied to them by the segregated patterns of their missionary   
upbringing; at the same time they tried to recapture and embel-   
lish an idealized childhood memory.   
  
My Western subjects had also found that confronted with China   

----------------------- Page 204-----------------------

over a period of time, one's identity could not, so to speak, stand   
still. Most, spiritual mediators more than anything else, gradually   
slipped into a "Chinese" pattern. They usually made an elaborate   
identity compromise, rather than completely "going native"; the   
compromise offered many creative satisfactions, but there was al-   
ways the danger, whether or not a Westerner was aware of it, of   
his old identities becoming obscured and his sense of commitment   
confused. Yet the same man could also identify a part of himself as   
uncompromisingly Western, and feel stirrings of the pure pros-   
  
RECOVERY AND RENEWAL 235   
  
elytizer. The psychological rewards for so doing were those of im-   
posing on others one's own creed and thereby exerting influence   
over others; the dangers (in a sense interchangeable with the re-   
wards) were those of arousing antagonism and persecution, and of   
becoming isolated from Chinese life. What is more, these subjects   
found that historical circumstances generated increasing tension   
between the mediator and the proselytizer within them. China, in   
its quest for modernization, both sought and resented various forms   
of proselytizing. Western institutions which sent people to China   
became more sensitive to the need for mediating, but these in-   
creasing sensitivities opened the way for the kind of historical and   
racial guilt I have already described.   
  
These conflicts were especially great for the priests among my   
subjects. Their education and characters bore the stamp of modern   
liberalism; they tended strongly to become cultural mediators, and   
play down the pure proselytizer within themselves. Even so, the   
conflict between these two aspects of their identity was ever-present:   
Father Luca was torn between his liberalism and his urge to mar-   
tyrdom; Father Vechten's deep commitment to spiritual mediating   
was certainly undermined by his confrontation in Rome with a   
more pure proselytizing attitude. All these men experienced with   
unusual intensity the inner struggle between liberal and authoritar-   
ian emotions which any modern Catholic priest faces. Many tried to   
resolve the struggle by using the approach of Father Vincent Lebbe,   
considered by many to be a modern counterpart of Father Ricci.   
One of the most articulate of modem mediators, he had condemned   
Western imperialism, refused the protection of his own consul, and   
advocated love for and intimate identification with the host coun-   
try; he had set a personal example by taking out Chinese citizen-   
ship and forming a stretcher-bearing battalion during the Japanese   
war. 15 But whatever the approach, the tension between these two   
elements had to remain, since they are both part of the identity of   
any missionary anywhere: the urge to proselytize takes him to the   
mission land in the first place; and the mediator within him makes   
his work possible.   
  
The Communists — themselves pure proselytizers in the extreme   
— were quick to make the association between missionary • pros-   
elytizing and imperialism, an association not too difficult to estab-   

----------------------- Page 205-----------------------

lish. It was a bit harder for them to cast a spiritual mediator as an   
  
236 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
imperialist, but they accomplished this also with two approaches:   
they held him responsible for the behavior of his less liberal col-   
leagues, and called his flexible adjustment a tactical maneuver to   
deceive people and obscure ultimate goals. Moreover, although   
Father Lebbe himself was a spiritual mediator, some of the priests   
(including close colleagues of my subjects) who had followed his   
lead in aiding China's defense efforts against the Japanese had   
gone on to co-operate with Nationalist forces in their struggle   
against the Communists — thus giving the reformers a good reason   
to label them imperialists.   
  
The Communists thus used actual historical events to exploit   
already-existing identity strains of the Westerner in China, sim-   
plifying the complex elements involved into the single pure image   
of the evil imperialist. They then did everything possible to make   
the man fit the image.   
  
During the years after their release, my subjects were preoc-   
cupied with extricating themselves from this pure image, and find-   
ing a version of what they had been (and still were) which was both   
reasonably accurate and morally justifiable. Some form of recon-   
struction was necessary, and the degree of distortion paralleled that   
of the thought reform experience itself. Thus Fathers Luca and   
Vechten could be critical of much of their Church's behavior and   
at the same time reject exaggerated Communist charges; while   
Bishop Barker brought his characteristic all-or-nothing fundamen-   
talist judgments to bear upon both the Church and the Communists.   
  
These men and women were aware that their prison thought   
reform marked the end of an era for the non-Communist Westerner   
in China, as well as for them as individuals. They had to achieve a   
new relationship with Western institutions to overcome the guilt   
associated with the imperialist label. What they sought during the   
years after imprisonment, and what many of them attained, was   
nothing short of another rebirth.   
  
Long-term Effects   
  
What can be said about the long-range success or failure of   
prison thought reform as applied to Westerners? From the stand-   
point of winning them over to a Communist view of the world,   
the program must certainly be judged a failure. Only one (Father   
  
RECOVERY AND RENEWAL 237   
  
Simon) among my twenty-five subjects (and only one or possibly   
two more from among the scores of others I heard about) could   
be regarded as a truly successful convert. Follow-up information con-   

----------------------- Page 206-----------------------

firmed what I had begun to observe when I interviewed these sub-   
jects in Hong Kong: a general movement away from the reform    
ethos toward a more critical view of Chinese Communist behavior.   
Three or four years after their release, most of them expressed   
sentiments much more harsh toward Communism than those they   
had felt before being imprisoned. They looked not to Communism,   
but to the forces in the West they had known earlier, and to an   
inner synthesis of their own, for answers to the world's great ide-   
ological questions. This conscious disavowal of their reform was by   
no means the entire psychological picture; but conscious opinions   
are, after all, not unimportant,   
  
Whatever success thought reform had with most of the West-   
erners lay in the unconscious influences which they retained from it.   
These influences are basic to an understanding of what really hap-   
pened, even though they can be easily overlooked. Despite the   
years that had passed since their imprisonment, these men and   
women were still grappling with the powerful emotions and ideas   
implanted by the Chinese Communists. Most had succeeded in   
neutralizing them; but the implant had been compelling enough to   
defy easy excision. For once a man has been put through prison   
thought reform, he never completely casts off its picture of the   
world and of himself.   
  
Inner tension between the reformed and nonreformed elements   
of a person can be itself imprisoning; or lead toward expanding   
horizons. Most people felt something of each, but the ratio be-   
tween the two varied greatly. Father Luca and Father Vechten, for   
example, had suffered and continued to suffer from a compulsive   
weighing of the influences of thought reform; yet both had broad-   
ened their personal vistas and enlarged their sense of identity as a   
result of their prison experiences. Father Simon and Bishop Barker,   
on the other hand, seemed to have narrowed their focus, con-   
stantly protecting themselves against too broad an exposure lest this   
upset their singlemindedness. It was generally true that those who,   
like Father Simon and Bishop Barker, were either apparent con-   
verts or apparent resisters, had to live on this constricted level if   
they were to maintain their extreme position; while the obviously   
  
238 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
confused reaped both pain and creative benefit from their con-   
fusion. Those who, like Miss Darrow, gradually gave up an extreme   
position, were opened to the same pitfalls and opportunities as   
they surrendered both their constriction and the reassuring cer-   
tainties it had offered. One other position is possible: one can, like   
Mr. Kallmann, become so "broad" in his horizons that the inner   
substance of identity and commitment can scarcely take shape.   
  
And this brings up the nonideological residua present in all   
Westerners, whose effects were also mixed. Four years after the   
experience, my subjects still bore marks of both fear and relief.   

----------------------- Page 207-----------------------

The fear was related to the basic fear mentioned earlier, the fear of   
total annihilation; it is an unconscious memory not easily lost.   
Some people may equate it with the experience of having felt totally   
controlled and dangerously threatened by a powerful parent; but   
whatever its associations, all dread the possibility of risking its re-   
currence through re-exposure to total control. Along with this dread,   
however, some entertain a deeply repressed desire for just such a   
repetition as a means of atoning for a troubling sense of guilt. I   
need not again emphasize the importance of this guilt, except to   
say that it joins with the residual fear to form the most destructive   
of thought reform's bequests.   
  
Nonetheless, thought reform can also produce a genuinely thera-   
peutic effect. Western subjects consistently reported a sense of   
having been benefited and emotionally strengthened, of having be-   
come more sensitive to their own and others' inner feelings, and   
more flexible and confident in human relationships. These bene-   
ficial effects occurred in subjects with all three reactions, although   
it is difficult to say just what produced them. The best explanation   
is perhaps that these people had had the experience of testing their   
emotional limits. They had undergone the ultimate in physical and   
spiritual pain, and had yet survived; they had been forced to hit   
rock bottom in their imposed negative self-analysis, and yet had   
emerged with some measure of self-respect. Each had thus gone   
farther than ever before in realizing his human potential. Their   
consequent feeling of having been benefited is analogous to the   
sense of well-being which has been observed in people after they   
have experienced severe stress of almost any kind, including that of   
prolonged sensory deprivation. 16 When the stress is brief, the well-   
being may be limited to a rebound euphoria. But after an experi-   
  
RECOVERY AND RENEWAL 239   
  
ence as totally disintegrating as prison thought reform, the relief at   
being put together again is more basic and more enduring. In the   
experience itself, and in the process of recovery and renewal which   
followed it, these men and women gained access to parts of them-   
selves they had never known existed.

CHAPTER   
  
THE ENCOUNTER   
  
In turning from imprisoned Westerners to "free"   
Chinese intellectuals, we arrive at the ideological   
center of the thought reform movement. Instead of being directed   
at alleged criminals and "imperialists," reform is used to manipu-   
late the passions of the most enlightened members of Chinese   
society. Chinese intellectuals experience thought reform in their   
own country's educational institutions, under the direction of coun-   
trymen not too different from themselves. They are asked to un-   
dergo it as an act of patriotism, as an expression of personal and   
national rejuvenation.   
  
Their thought reform is not entirely different from the prison   
program applied to Westerners. Indeed, as I alternated between   
Western and Chinese subjects during the study, I was often struck   
by the similarities in the emotional experiences reported by two   
such divergent groups. But the contrasts were also impressive —   
contrasts in thought reform settings and pressures, in life experi-   
ences and character traits, and in differing relationships to Chinese   
Communism — so much so that I sometimes felt as if I were con-   
ducting two separate research projects.   
  
An exploration of these differences takes us inevitably into mat-   
ters Chinese, into a consideration of influences derived from tradi-   
tional Chinese culture and from the modern, antitraditional Chi-   
nese cultural rebellion. Only these patterns can account for China's   
  
243   
  
244 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
unique way of dealing with imported Communist principles. I shall   
retain my emphasis upon individual emotions and the sense of   
inner identity, and move from the individual outward as I attempt   
to explain his experience in the light of his own and his country's   
history and culture. This approach also requires an examination of   
thought reform's origins, both its actual history, and its use of   
psychological themes derived from Soviet Russian and traditional   
Chinese models. After that, I shall summarize the general prin-   
ciples derived from my study of both subject groups — principles   
which apply to any culture and have significance far beyond that   
of thought reform itself.   
  

----------------------- Page 209-----------------------

Who are the "Chinese intellectuals"? The term is a loose one and   
is often applied to anyone in China with a secondary school educa-   
tion, although the Communists themselves distinguish between   
"higher intellectuals" and "general intellectuals." It includes, of   
course, scholars, teachers, artists, writers, scientists, advanced stu-   
dents, physicians, and other professional people — all of whom make   
up a very small but particularly influential segment of the Chinese   
population. As a group, they are the spiritual if not lineal descend-   
ants of the Confucian literati, the celebrated class of scholar-   
officials who in the past set the cultural standards and administered   
the political structure for whatever dynasty they served. Nowhere   
was learning more honored than in traditional China, and nowhere   
was a body of knowledge more necessary for personal advancement;   
until the beginning of the twentieth century, the main path to   
wealth and prestige was the state examination based entirely upon   
the Confucian classics.   
  
But during the last fifty years, the intellectuals, influenced by the   
West, have led the revolutionary movements to cast off the decay-   
ing traditional social structure. Much of their identity was trans-   
formed in the process, and the rebellion was costly to them in an   
emotional as well as a material sense. Yet even when most be-   
leaguered, they have always retained their aura of a learned elite   
and a sharp sense of separation from the rest of the mostly illiterate   
population.   
  
Like the dynasties before them (and like Communist parties   
everywhere) the Chinese Communists recognized the importance   
of winning over and putting to effective use this precious intellectual   
  
THE ENCOUNTER 245   
  
talent. Indeed, their thought reform program has gone far beyond   
anything either their dynastic predecessors or their Russian Com-   
munist mentors ever attempted. They called for a personal con-   
version (or for something very closely resembling one) from every   
Chinese intellectual, surely an excessively ambitious program. Yet   
during the period immediately after they assumed power, many   
circumstances favored their efforts.   
  
The Communists were then in the full flush of triumph. Their   
discipline and their confidence could not fail to impress a popula-   
tion which had been spiritually sapped by decades of civil war,   
foreign encroachments, and political corruption. Well before this   
a sizable number of intellectuals had been attracted to the Com-   
munist movement, many of whom had been introduced to it dur-   
ing their student days. By 1949, intellectuals as a group — including   
those with no particular ideological commitment — seemed more   
prone to welcome than to oppose the Communist victory. This was   
the impression of many observers and scholars, and one also clearly   
conveyed to me by my Chinese subjects and by friends in Hong   
Kong. Most intellectuals and students regarded the Nationalist   

----------------------- Page 210-----------------------

regime with bitter hostility. They resented what they felt were   
police-state methods without the compensation of police-state ef-   
ficiency. If one can speak of a class despair — a despair born of dis-   
illusionment, emotional confusion, repeated frustration, and eco-   
nomic suffering accompanying runaway inflation — one may cer-   
tainly say it of the Chinese intellectuals during the years before the   
Communist takeover. In this condition, many of them were recep-   
tive not only to change, but to methods of being changed which   
they might otherwise have abhorred. 1   
  
Some Chinese intellectuals (although by no means all) had an   
opportunity to acquaint themselves gradually with Communist re-   
form measures through small "political study" and "mutual aid"   
groups organized where they lived, worked, or studied. These were   
dogmatic, but relatively mild compared with what followed. By   
late 1951, all intellectuals were swept up in a year-long Thought   
Reform Campaign primarily aimed at them as a group — the first   
of China's national outbreaks of soul-searching. One Chinese com-   
mentator, writing from Hong Kong, described this campaign as   
"one of the most spectacular events in human history." 2 Other   
equally spectacular campaigns were to come; but this one set the   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
precedent, and its sequence of top-to-bottom manipulations — typical   
for all national campaigns — is worth describing. 8   
  
First came the mandate from Mao Tse-tung himself: "Ideological   
reform, first of all the ideological reform of the intellectuals, is one   
of the most important conditions for a country's all-out complete   
democratic reform and industrialization." Next, the central ministry   
of education called together three thousand leading university pro-   
fessors and academic administrators of the Peking-Tientsin area to   
launch a "study campaign" aimed at "the reform of the teachers'   
ideology and of higher education." Premier Chou En-lai addressed   
this group for five hours, spelling out in detail a program for trans-   
forming the university into a genuinely "progressive" institution,   
and stressing such personal reform issues as "standpoint," "atti-   
tude," "whom we serve," "problems of thought," "problems of   
knowledge," "problems of democracy," and "criticism and self-   
criticism." (One of the educators present reported that Chou set a   
personal example with a self-criticism of his own "social relations.")   
Then, under Communist guidance, study groups were formed. At   
the same time, the campaign was given wide publicity in news-   
papers, magazines, and radio broadcasts; and through organizational   
work, it spread from the capital city outward, to all universities and   
intellectual communities throughout China.   
  
Centered in universities (but including all intellectuals, whatever   
their affiliations), the campaign included everyone from the elderly   
college president to the newly-admitted freshman student, as "tens   
of thousands of intellectuals . . . [were] brought to their knees, ac-   

----------------------- Page 211-----------------------

cusing themselves relentlessly at tens of thousands of meetings and   
in tens of millions of written words." 4 This was the campaign's   
harvest: a flood of self-castigation from China's most learned men,   
public confessions which became a prominent feature in the coun-   
try's press during the next few months, and on repeated occasions   
from then on. Combining personal anecdote, philosophical so-   
phistication, and stereotyped jargon, the confessions followed a con-   
sistent pattern: first, the denunciation of one's past — of personal   
immorality and erroneous views; then a description of the way in   
which one was changing all of this under Communist guidance; and   
finally, a humble expression of remaining defects and a pledge to   
work hard at overcoming them with the help of progressive col-   
leagues and Party members.   
  
THE ENCOUNTER 247   
  
Distinguished scholars denounced careers that had brought them   
international fame, and expressed the desire to begin over again in   
their work and in their lives. One prominent feature (also present   
in the case histories ) was the professor's public humiliation before   
his own students: a professor of law, for instance, in making his   
confession before a large meeting of undergraduates, addressed them   
as "fellow students," went on to thank them for their suggestions   
and to promise to adhere to these "in the most minute detail so   
that I can improve myself," then closed with the pledge "to be   
your pupil and to learn from you." (These confessions must be   
read to appreciate their full flavor; the published confession of a   
Harvard-trained professor of philosophy, made at a leading uni-   
versity in Peking, appears in the Appendix, page 473.) While much   
of the content of these documents seems ritualistic and uncon-   
vincing, my Western subjects made it clear that even such expres-   
sions are by no means free of emotional involvement, and reflect   
pressures of immense magnitude. Students outdid their professors   
in reform enthusiasms.   
  
During the two years of Communist rule before this official   
campaign began, however, many intellectuals underwent their   
thought reform in special centers called "revolutionary universities"   
or "revolutionary colleges." These institutions provided the most   
concentrated of programs, sealed-in worlds in which thought reform   
existed in its own pure culture. The revolutionary university was   
directly derived from Party schools in which (see Chapter 20) the   
reform program for Chinese intellectuals had been developed years   
before; these schools were quietly conducted prototypes for the   
later, more flamboyant public displays.   
  
Set up in every area of China almost in the wake of the victorious   
Communist armies, revolutionary universities were most active dur-   
ing the regime's first few years; by 1952, many had been converted   
into more conventional cadre-training centers. One of their pur-   
poses was to meet an emergency need for trained personnel; the   
course was usually only six months long, at most eight or twelve   

----------------------- Page 212-----------------------

months, and the student body was by no means exclusive. It in-   
cluded such groups as former officials of the Nationalist regime,   
professors from ordinary universities in a particular area; "returned"   
students from the West, some who had just come back and others   
who had been to Europe or America as long as thirty or forty years   
  
248 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
before; and arbitrarily selected groups of young university instruc-   
tors, recent graduates, and even undergraduates. There were also   
Communist party members and affiliates, some of whom had dem-   
onstrated significant "errors" in their work or thoughts, and others   
who had merely spent enough time in Kuomintang areas to be con-   
sidered contaminated by the exposure.   
  
Many came to revolutionary universities in response to thinly-   
veiled coercion — the strong "suggestion" that they attend. But   
others actively sought admission because they wished to adapt   
themselves to the new regime, or at least to find out what was ex-   
pected of them; they believed, moreover, that a diploma from one   
of these centers would be a big help in the New China. And, as the   
first Chinese case history demonstrates, some sought admission to   
solve personal problems in their relationships to the Communist   
regime.   
  
I soon became aware that the programs at both regular uni-   
versities and revolutionary universities had maximum importance   
for Chinese intellectuals and maximum psychological interest for   
my research. Twelve of my fifteen subjects underwent their reforms   
at one or the other, and the four case histories I shall describe are   
equally divided between them. I have given the revolutionary col-   
lege the most detailed attention, because I believe it represents   
the hard core of the entire Chinese thought reform movement. But   
before we attempt to penetrate this core, I must say a bit more about   
my Chinese subjects, and the nature of my work with them.   
  
As a group, they could not show as wide a spectrum of responses   
to thought reform as the Westerners whom I interviewed, for they   
were all essentially thought reform failures. They belonged to that   
small minority of Chinese intellectuals who had elected to leave the   
mainland and remain in Hong Kong as refugees from the Com-   
munist regime. They are therefore in no sense typical of Chinese   
intellectuals in general. But neither are their reactions unrelated to   
those of the larger body of intellectuals who remained: even as   
thought reform failures, they had some positive responses which   
can help us understand the program's successes; and their negative   
reactions, although stronger than those of the majority of intel-   
lectuals, can help us to appreciate some of the stumbling blocks   
thought reform ran into with China's intellectuals. Moreover, the   
nature of the reform process — its stress on close contact and on the   
  
THE ENCOUNTER 249   

----------------------- Page 213-----------------------

  
psychological expos6— enabled my subjects to make telling observa-   
tions about others who responded quite differently from themselves.   
  
Chinese subjects, of course, could not avoid the psychological and   
financial strains of their refugee status. Sometimes one of them   
would attempt to use an interview with me as a forum to attack,   
not the Communists or the Nationalists, but a rival refugee or-   
ganization. Most were living under conditions which were, at best,   
tenuous, and they tended to look upon their participation in the   
research as a potential means of sooner or later bettering their lot.   
This attitude was in keeping with Chinese views of reciprocity; as   
L. S. Yang has pointed out, when a Chinese acts, he anticipates a   
response: "Favors done for others are often considered what may   
be termed 'social investments,' for which handsome returns are   
expected." 8 A Chinese subject, understandably enough, usually   
wanted material rather than psychological assistance from me; and   
some of the "handsome returns" expected (or at least hoped for)   
included my recommending a particular refugee organization to an   
American group whose assistance was desired, my helping a man to   
obtain a job with a Western organization in Hong Kong, or my   
supporting a man's efforts to enter the United States.   
  
I decided that financial remuneration in some form was in order,   
both because these people badly needed money, and because it   
could serve as my reciprocal response in place of other expectations,   
which usually were impossible (if not inadvisable) for me to meet.   
But I felt that paying by the interview would not be a good idea,   
since it might create an incentive for a subject to hold back mate-   
rial in order to prolong the financial opportunity, and also because   
it might have conveyed the undesirable suggestion that I was pay-   
ing for information. I hit upon a compromise arrangement which   
worked so well that I used it throughout the study. I had the sub-   
ject prepare written materials useful to my work, most often a near    
verbatim reconstruction of the final thought summary originally   
composed during thought reform itself; and for this I paid the   
standard Hong Kong publication rate for an article of approxi-   
mately that length. If my relationship with a subject was prolonged,   
I simply repeated the procedure after a certain number of inter-   
views, and asked the subject to contribute additional autobiograph-   
ical information that was of special significance in his case. This   
arrangement proved to be highly beneficial and face-saving for both   
  
250 THOUGHT REFORM   
of US.   
  
My interpreters were also refugee intellectuals, and this too cre-   
ated problems. Subjects often felt more uneasy about revealing   
themselves, especially their political convictions, to fellow Chinese   
refugees than they did to me. I was a relatively harmless American;   
but who could tell what my interpreter's affiliations might be? Some-   
times a subject required that a friend of his serve as interpreter, an   

----------------------- Page 214-----------------------

arrangement I accepted only when I also knew the person sug-   
gested and thought he was suitable. And even then, I usually tried   
to replace him with one of my own interpreters for some portion   
of the work. Other subjects cultivated the interpreter after hours,   
hoping to win his support for a favor from me. For all of these   
reasons, I considered it extremely important that the interpreter   
strongly identify himself with me and with the research. The two   
men I regularly worked with were personal friends who more than   
met my requirements.   
  
These considerations were important because my interpreters   
were required to do a good deal more than simply translate back   
and forth during the interviews: as Westernized Chinese, they were   
a bridge between the relatively un- Westernized Chinese subject   
and the (also relatively) un-Sinicized Western interviewer. David   
Riesman has called this "tandem interviewing": the interpreter   
served as an acculturating force in both directions, making it pos-   
sible for the subject and myself — between whom there was no   
common language and much cultural distance — to converse with   
one another. There had to be a certain amount of compromise:   
the subject had to adapt himself to my Western approach and I   
had to bend slightly in a Chinese direction. This included, on my   
part, serving tea with each interview, the unconscious development   
of a bit more reserve than usual, and the conscious development of   
an indirect (or circular) approach to the more sensitive topics   
discussed.   
  
I have emphasized the difficulties I encountered owing to the   
Chineseness and the refugee status of this subject group (the lat-   
ter condition perhaps created more problems than did the former);   
but once the three of us had surmounted these early barriers, a   
three-way team enthusiasm often developed. All of us directed our   
full energies toward illuminating the nuances of the subject's emo-   
tions and then conveying these to me as the final common pathway;   
  
THE ENCOUNTER 251   
  
and all of us shared in the excitement of achieving a deepening   
understanding of thought reform. These interviews were often quite   
grueling, and required at least twice as much time as ordinary inter-   
views to cover the same ground; but they had a special fascination.   
After months of work, a significant therapeutic relationship often   
developed in both interpreted and direct (English language) inter-   
views with Chinese subjects. This usually did not have the same   
cathartic intensity as with Westerners (although with one English-   
speaking girl it did); rather there was a gradual shift from my prob-   
ing to the subject's raising questions on his own about past and   
present emotions which had troubled him.   
  
On the whole, my Chinese subject group was young, with a   
heavy student representation. I did not intentionally seek young   
subjects; their preponderance was due to a number of reasons.   

----------------------- Page 215-----------------------

They were available to me through the refugee publishing organ-   
izations to which they belonged; and younger people could more   
easily leave Communist China after intensive thought reform,   
both with and without official permission: they had fewer family   
responsibilities, greater anonymity, and better excuses (visiting   
parents in Hong Kong during university vacations for example) to   
cross the border. This accidental emphasis upon youth turned out   
to be a great advantage. It helped me to achieve better understand-   
ing of the phenomenal role which young people have played in   
revolutionary twentieth-century China, and it shed light upon psy-   
chological questions relating to identity and change. The subject   
group did not lack diversity, however; it included college students   
in their late teens and early twenties, seasoned revolutionaries in   
their thirties, and experienced government officials close to middle   
age. My subjects came from all parts of China, and from such di-   
verse backgrounds as middle-class urban merchant families, rural   
gentry, and, rarely, rural peasantry.   
  
The Chinese subject group may be broken down as follows: total   
— fifteen; locale of thought reform experience — seven in regular   
universities, five in revolutionary colleges, two in military settings,   
and one in a business group; occupation at time of thought reform   
— seven students, two displaced students, two government officials   
(both of whom had done some university teaching), one university   
instructor, two soldiers, and one businessman (in the Hong Kong   
environment, thirteen of the subjects were in an ill-defined group   
  
25Z THOUGHT REFORM   
  
of students-teachers-writers, and the other two were in business);   
geographical distribution — seven from the Hunan-Hupei-Anhui   
area (South Central China); four from the Peking area (North   
Central China); and four from the Canton area (South China);   
sex — twelve male, three female; age — from nineteen to forty-nine,   
mostly between twenty and thirty-five.   
  
Chinese subjects were on the whole more removed in time from   
their thought reform than the Western group, most having experi-   
enced it one to four years before our interviews. This time lapse   
increased the possibility of retrospective distortion, which I had   
always to keep in mind. To get underneath any such distortion, I   
encouraged each subject to try to recapture during our interviews   
the actual emotions of his reform, rather than merely talk about   
them from a distance. I eventually got most of them to do this to   
a considerable extent, because there is something about the reform   
process which causes it to retain an unusually high degree of emo-   
tional vividness for the former participant. Only after extensive   
efforts of this kind — including much focused questioning and re-   
checking of responses, as well as an over-all estimation of a man's   
reliability of recall — did I attempt to reconstruct an individual case.   
  
As I participated in the subject's recapturing process, I often felt   

----------------------- Page 216-----------------------

that I was listening to a Gulliver telling of his travels in a very   
strange land. That strange land was not so much China as it was   
thought reform— especially the alien realm of the revolutionary   
university.   
  
CHAPTER   
  
THE REVOLUTIONARY   
  
UNIVERSITY: MR. HU   
  
Early in my stay in Hong Kong I was introduced to   
Mr. Hu Wei-han, a native of Hupeh province in   
Central China, and a graduate of North China University, a large   
revolutionary university 1 situated just outside of Peking. I met   
him in the customary fashion, through intermediaries: a Chi-   
nese acquaintance of mine was working closely with him in a   
"third force" (critical of both Communists and Nationalists) press   
service. Mr. Hu was then thirty, tall and thin, erect and dignified,   
if a bit rigid, in his bearing. Courteous and formal in the fashion   
of an upper-class Chinese, he spoke in quiet, measured tones, al-   
ways with intensity. I soon noticed that he rarely smiled; his facial   
expression was invariably serious, not infrequently sullen, never   
really relaxed. At the same time, he maintained throughout our   
sessions an unusual degree of enthusiasm and stamina.   
  
Although he had left Communist China four years before, he   
was still cautious about interview arrangements. For a while, he   
preferred to meet at his own office, although later he came reg-   
ularly to my apartment. He insisted that the friend who had intro-   
duced us serve as interpreter (although months later, after a falling   
out with his friend, he welcomed the substitution of one of my   
regular interpreters). And at first he wondered whether I wasn't   
  
*53   
  
254 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
"something more than a psychiatrist." But over the course of six-   
teen months of interviews (twenty-five meetings totalling about   
eighty hours), he became increasingly open and spontaneous. In-   
deed, after a few all-day sessions during the first weeks of our work   
together, we got to know each other quite well.   
  
At the time Hu began his thought reform, he was no stranger   
to the Communist movement. He had been sympathetic to it since   
his middle-school days, and as a student leader at the University of   
Nanking he had worked closely with the Communist underground   
for several years. Just after the takeover, however, he became in-   
volved in a controversy with Communist officials which eventually   
led to his admission to North China University. Appointed to a   
special committee set up at the University of Nanking, he had   

----------------------- Page 217-----------------------

spoken strongly in favor of keeping the University in session, in   
opposition to the Communist representatives who wanted it tem-   
porarily closed down. Not only was he overruled, he was "tricked   
into accepting their point of view." Deeply upset by this experi-   
ence ("My views . . . were widely known. . . . Now I considered   
myself a failure. I had no face to see my fellow students"), he de-   
cided to leave Nanking. Hoping that things might be better in the   
north, he went to Peking and sought, through well-situated friends,   
some position within the Communist movement. Meeting with   
little success, he expressed his disappointment to one of these   
friends, who in reply offered the following advice:   
  
Your thoughts are still those of the bourgeoisie. You must change for   
the great period ahead. You should go to North China University for   
ideological reform and they will help you to make the change.   
  
Still wishing to find a place in the new regime, Hu accepted the   
idea that a change in his thoughts might be necessary. He took his   
friend's words seriously, and hearing that a class was about to begin,   
embarked on the short trip to the revolutionary university. A letter   
of recommendation which he had obtained from a high-ranking   
Communist official served as his admission credentials.   
  
The Great Togetherness: Group Identification   
  
Hu found himself in an atmosphere that was austere but   
friendly: an open area with low wooden buildings which served as   
living quarters and places of study; old students (who had arrived   
  
THE REVOLUTIONARY UNIVERSITY 255   
  
a week or two before) and Communist cadres warm in their greet-   
ings, helpful in their orienting tours, and enthusiastic in their talk   
about the revolutionary university, the Communist movement, the   
new hope for the future. He was assigned to a small group of nine   
other young intellectuals much like himself. Because of his superior   
knowledge of Marxism he was elected by this group to be its leader,   
which thus thrust him directly into the organizational hierarchy.   
  
He discovered that the revolutionary university was a huge estab-   
lishment, tightly organized along Communist principles of "demo-   
cratic centralism." It contained four large sections each with more   
than a thousand students. His section consisted of miscellaneous   
young intellectuals and was the largest; he estimated that it included   
about three thousand men and women. The other three were made   
up of "cultural workers" (writers and artists), older professors and   
former government officials (a well-publicized invitation to the   
school had been extended to many such prominent figures), and   
teachers in training. The nominal head of the institution, who gave   
the official welcoming speech and presided over other ritual oc-   
casions, was an elderly educator formerly associated with the KMT;   
real authority was in the hands of the four section heads, who were   

----------------------- Page 218-----------------------

Party members, and the subsection heads and class heads who   
worked under them. Each class head was responsible for the re-   
form of one hundred students (ten small groups), and had at his   
disposal three special assistants.   
  
These three assistants, who acted as links between the faculty and   
students, were the cadres. (This term is used for Communist "or-   
ganization men" — lower-level officials, usually but not necessarily   
Party members, whose lives are inseparable from Party activity, and   
who express at all times the Party point of view.) The three cadres   
performed the day-to-day legwork of reform. They knew the pro-   
cedure well, not only because they had guided previous classes   
through it, but also because they had experienced it themselves as   
part of their training. 2 Each of the cadres had a designated function:   
the "executive cadre" was concerned with courses of study, reports,   
and records; the "organizing cadre" was most intimately involved   
with group activities and with the attitudes of individual students;   
the "advisory cadre" (the only one of the three who might be a   
woman) concerned himself with the students' personal affairs and   
reading habits, and offered counsel on ideological problems. Hu   
  
256 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
noticed that the three cadres assigned to his class worked as a unit;   
they were approachable separately, but always united in policy, and   
even made many of their public appearances together.   
  
During the first days at the university, the cadres were rarely in   
evidence: the students were left to themselves in complete freedom,   
and told to "just get to know each other." To Hu and to most of   
the others, the atmosphere was exhilarating. Initial reserve quickly   
gave way, and students began to reveal to one another details of   
their backgrounds, and of their frustrations, beliefs, and future   
aspirations. Forgetting his recent conflict with the Communists,   
Hu was caught up in the general enthusiasm and the high esprit de   
corps:   
  
The revolutionary university seemed to be a place which brought   
together young people from all over with a great deal in common. We   
ate, slept and talked together, all of us eager to make new friends. The   
ten of us were at first strangers, but we quickly developed a strong   
bond. ... I had very warm feelings toward the group and toward the   
school. I felt I was being treated well in a very free atmosphere. I was   
happy and thought that I was on my way to a new life.   
  
Only one incident, which occurred about ten days after Hu's ar-   
rival, marred an otherwise perfect honeymoon period — an incident   
which revealed much about Hu, and initiated a pattern in his rela-   
tionship to school authorities which persisted throughout his six   
months at the revolutionary university. While taking an after-   
dinner stroll, he came upon an informal gathering of about one   
hundred students and three cadres. He listened as one of the   

----------------------- Page 219-----------------------

cadres explained that Marxism was an "everlasting truth of so-   
ciety"; but during the discussion which followed, he got up and   
politely but definitely disagreed with this statement, asserting that   
Marxism was no more than a "guiding principle of a certain period"   
which would probably be replaced by a new doctrine once the tran-   
sition from capitalism to socialism had been accomplished. Hu re-   
called the incident (possibly exaggerating it in retrospect) in dra-   
matic terms:   
  
It was late at night, and there was no electric light. We had only an   
oil lamp and it was dim with shadows. When the discussion reached its   
climax . . . many of the students agreed with me. . . . and I was in   
a more powerful position than the cadres. . . . Someone started ap-   
plause and it spread to most of the group. Rarely could an idea in such   
opposition to the cadres gain such a response.   
  
THE REVOLUTIONARY UNIVERSITY 257   
  
Hu felt that this incident gained him respect among the other   
students, but that his outspoken behavior had caused the authorities   
to begin to regard him as an "individualist" and a man to be   
watched. Soon after this the same cadre began to criticize Hu   
strongly, to a degree that Hu felt was above and beyond the call of   
thought reform duty. He attributed this to his having caused the   
cadre a public loss of face, and gave a clear explanation of what he   
meant by this: "He was supposed to be the most distinguished per-   
son among us; by opposing him openly and gaining public support   
during the discussion. ... I disgraced him in a Chinese sense."   
  
After two weeks of this shared informality, all the students in Hu's   
class were called together for "thought mobilization" meetings at   
which the philosophy of the program was forcefully presented. In-   
dividual thought reform was to be a part of the over-all reform of   
Chinese society. Just as past social evils had to be swept away, so did   
one have to remedy one's personal evil if he wished to take his place   
in this great renaissance. For a Chinese intellectual, reform was a   
particularly pressing matter: his talents were urgently needed by   
"the people," and yet his class background had so "poisoned" him   
that until he was reformed, he was unable to serve them.   
  
Next came the beginning of formal courses, the first of which was   
entitled the History of the Development of Society. This course was   
followed by: Lenin — The State; Materialistic Dialectics; History   
of the Chinese Revolution; Theory of the New Democracy —   
Maoism; and Field Study — visits to old Communist workshops and   
industrial centers. A leading Communist theorist came from Peking   
to deliver the opening lecture (there was just one lecture for each   
course). This talk was a memorable one: for more than five hours   
the distinguished visitor presented a carefully-documented exposi-   
tion of Marxist views on organic evolution (the emergence of man   
from lower primates by means of labor, or as a popular pamphlet   
put it: "From monkey to man, through labor"), and on social evo-   

----------------------- Page 220-----------------------

lution (the development of human society from its primitive com-   
munist stage through subsequent "slave," "feudal," "capitalist,"   
"socialist," and inevitable "Communist" stages). The thousand stu-   
dents in the audience listened carefully, and took copious notes.   
There were no interruptions and no questions at the end.   
  
Rather, the students quickly reassembled in their small groups   
to discuss the lecture material. And from then on, these hsiieh hsi   
  
258 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
sessions continued virtually all day, every day, until they were in-   
terrupted for another marathon lecture introducing a new course.   
A major national event, such as a speech by Mao Tse-tung, might   
also be the occasion for larger gatherings, and a temporary change   
in the subject matter of the small group sessions as well.   
  
As group leader, Hu guided the hsiieh hsi discussions, and tried   
to clarify the lecture material for the other students. He and the   
other nine group leaders of his class held daily (sometimes twice   
daily) meetings with a cadre, during which each gave a rundown on   
the attitude and progress of the individual members of his group.   
The other students knew about these reports, but seemed, on the   
whole, to accept them as regular organizational procedure. Hu was   
instructed by the cadre to take a "relatively neutral" attitude in his   
group, and to encourage free and lively discussion. He enjoyed both   
his teaching and his organizational responsibilities. He shared with   
the other students a sense of pulling together toward a common   
goal in a spirit of crusade.   
  
The Closing In: Conflict and "Struggle"   
  
After a few weeks of this study, however, Hu noticed a gradual   
change. The cadre receiving his daily reports demanded more de-   
tailed analyses of the other students' behavior; less stress was put   
on Marxist theory and more on individual attitudes. Hu was no   
longer enjoying the role he was asked to play: "My intention was to   
help the students to study about Communism, but I soon began to   
realize that the Communists were more interested in my helping   
them to study the students." At the same time, it was made clear   
to him that he was to be no longer neutral in his attitude, but was   
instead (in Mao's phrase) to "lean to one side," to support the   
"progressive elements," and to apply stronger pressures to the others   
in the direction of reform.   
  
Matters came to a head at the time of the first "thought sum-   
mary"; each student prepared one of these at the end of every   
course. The cadres passed along information — via group leaders and   
informal contacts in such places as the dining room — about the   
form these summaries should take: they were mainly to discuss the   
influence of the first course upon the student's previous views of   
society. A two-day period was devoted to writing the summary; then   

----------------------- Page 221-----------------------

  
THE REVOLUTIONARY UNIVERSITY 259   
  
each of these students was required to read his to the other group   
members, each of whom offered criticisms. Some of the students,   
still influenced by the easy-going atmosphere of the honeymoon pe-   
riod, took the matter lightly and dashed off their summaries with-   
out much thought; but Hu noticed that the cadres took it very   
seriously, and that they made a practice of sitting in on some of the   
summary readings to make sure that the criticisms were thorough   
and penetrating.   
  
Criticisms gave rise to countercriticisms, and group harmony   
gave way to tense antagonisms. The descriptions of past and present   
attitudes which students had so freely offered each other during   
the first days now came back to haunt them. Previously quiet stu-   
dents suddenly became "activists," stepping up the pace of criti-   
cism and intensifying the emotional tone within the group. Some   
of these activists identified themselves as members of the Commu-   
nist Youth Corps or of the Communist Party itself, thus emerging   
from an underground status. Their regular attendance at Party and   
Youth Corps meetings gave them a channel to the school hierarchy   
which, in terms of real power, superseded Hu's authority as group   
leader. When Hu realized this, he became increasingly uncom-   
fortable — aware that he was being informed on, but never quite sure   
just when and by whom. He als o noted that the authorities had   
begun to shift students about from one group to another in order   
to make most effective use of activists, always keeping in his group   
one or two who could exert strong influence. And his experience   
with his own thought summary increased his apprehension. Al-   
though it was fully orthodox in form and content, he had made it   
somewhat terse. He was strongly criticized by an activist who ac-   
cused him of concealing details, and the interested presence of all   
three cadres convinced him that the faculty was showing special   
concern about his personal progress.   
  
From this point on, pressures steadily mounted, and Hu lived in   
an atmosphere of criticism, self-criticism, and confession much like   
the prison environment of the Western subjects. Not only ideas, but   
underlying motivations were carefully scrutinized. Students were   
taken to task for failure to achieve the correct "materialistic view-   
point," "proletarian (or "people's") standpoint," and "dialectical   
methodology" — and the reasons for these failures were analyzed   
even more carefully than in prison reform. As a group leader, Hu   
  
260 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
helped to promote this orthodoxy; as a student, he was himself   
sometimes rebuked for railing to live up to it.   
  
His advanced theoretical knowledge of Communism served him   
well, but it did not render him immune from the array of standard   

----------------------- Page 222-----------------------

criticisms which in the revolutionary college covered an even broader   
spectrum than in the prison. The prisoner was attacked for his   
associations with imperialism and for his own "imperialistic traits";   
the student at the revolutionary university was mainly under fire   
for his "individualism." As interpreted from Mao's writings by   
cadres, activists, and the student rank and file, this term was ex-   
tended to include any tendency to follow personal inclinations   
rather than the path charted out by the Party. Since this meant   
"placing one's own interests above those of 'the people,' " individ-   
ualism was considered highly immoral. And so were the other   
faults for which the students were repeatedly criticized and for   
which they criticized others: "subjectivism" — applying to a problem   
a personal viewpoint rather than a "scientific" Marxist approach;   
"objectivism" — undue detachment, viewing oneself "above class   
distinction," or "posing as a spectator of the new China"; "senti-   
mentalism" — allowing one's attachments to family or friends to   
interfere with reform needs, and therefore "carrying about an   
ideological burden" (usually a reluctance to denounce the objects   
of one's sentimentalism); as well as "deviationism," "opportunism,"   
"dogmatism," "reflecting exploiting class ideology," "overly techni-   
cal viewpoints," "bureaucratism," "individual heroism," "revision-   
ism," "departmentalism," "sectarianism," and (neither last nor   
least) "pro-American outlook."   
  
Hu, in the eyes of cadres and fellow-students, was clearly an in-   
dividualist. His unsolicited public debate with the cadre had   
given him this status at the onset, and his subsequent behavior did   
little to dispel it. Even though he conducted himself in an ex-   
emplary fashion — "progressive" in attitude, circumspect in man-   
ner, conscientious in carrying out his responsibilities as a group   
leader — it was clear to everyone that he was holding much of   
himself back. He did not join in group enthusiasms, and kept to   
himself as much as he could in such an environment. In his reports   
to the cadre as group leader, he maintained a correct standard of   
Communist-style analysis, but at the same time tried always to say   
as little as possible, and to avoid making damaging assessments of   
  
THE REVOLUTIONARY UNIVERSITY 261   
  
other students. These reports were a source of great inner con-   
flict to him: he hated the idea of informing upon others, yet he   
could not fully dissociate himself from the cadres' claim that these   
evaluations served a moral purpose in "helping" backward students;   
in any case, he felt compelled — as a means of adapting to pressures   
brought to bear upon him — to offer some degree of compliance.   
  
When criticized, he would admit his shortcomings, and even   
go on to make the proper self-criticism in attributing them to "ruling   
class" and "bourgeois" influences in his family and educational   
background. But there was something perfunctory in his manner of   
doing so, and the cadres sensed his inner resistance. Often one or   
more of them would make a friendly approach to him, suggesting   

----------------------- Page 223-----------------------

that he seemed troubled by "ideological problems," asking him to   
"talk things over." They would go on to tell him that they con-   
sidered him a man of great promise, the type needed by the Party,   
one who would go far in the organization. They even described   
other cases of similar young men, also highly individualistic at   
the time of their thought reform, who had, after ridding them-   
selves of this deficiency, become high-ranking Communist officials.   
  
Hu did not respond to these overtures. Instead he felt his inner   
opposition steadily mounting ("I was becoming more and more   
sick of the process"), and his inability to discuss his true senti-   
ments with anyone an increasing strain:   
  
I could never have a chance to talk about these things or about what I   
considered to be right. I had to restrain myself constantly, to be patient,   
to avoid offending the cadres or the activists. I always had to conceal   
what was on my mind. ... I could never feel easy.   
  
Hu began to sense that the cadres were antagonistic to him, and   
he feared that, should he make one false move, they might well   
label him a "reactionary" — a dangerous accusation for anyone. He   
found himself in the paradoxical position of still retaining his   
general faith in the Chinese Communist movement, while feeling   
increasingly trapped in his personal thought reform experience.   
  
His dilemma increased as the moralistic tone of the criticism   
and self-criticism process extended into every aspect of his daily   
existence. As in the prison setting (but in a "native" rather than   
"imperialist" frame) students were criticized for such "bourgeois"   
or "ruling class" characteristics as pride, conceit, greed, com-   
  
262 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
petitiveness, dishonesty, boastfulness, and rudeness. And when   
liaisons between the sexes developed (the revolutionary university   
was co-educational, although living quarters for men and women   
were completely separate) these were discussed within the small   
groups and evaluated solely in terms of their effect on the reform   
progress of the two people involved. If a "backward" girl friend   
was thought to be impeding a student's progress, he was advised   
to break off the relationship; but if both were "progressive," or if   
one were thought to be aiding the other's progress, the group would   
give its approval. One female activist gave evidence of a romantic   
interest in Hu, but he was unresponsive and highly suspicious   
(probably with justification) of her motives. Sexual unions were,   
on the whole, discouraged, as it was felt that they drained energies   
from the thought reform process. The opportunity for romance   
was limited anyway, since the days were taken up almost com-   
pletely by hsiieh hsi, and the evenings by additional meetings and   
by reading. Sunday, although nominally a day of rest, was fre-   
quently devoted to self-examinations that had not been completed   
during the week; and such entertainments as there were — movies,   

----------------------- Page 224-----------------------

plays, group singing, and dancing — were invariably tied in with   
some aspect of the Communist ideological message. Students in   
Hu's section were not expected to leave the grounds of the revolu-   
tionary university unless they had some special reason.   
  
As in prisons, the atmosphere became saturated with individual   
confessions. Instead of criminal activities, each student was ex-   
pected to reveal everything about past affiliations with "reactionary"   
groups (usually the KMT regime or its student organizations).   
Each course became a vehicle for exposing more of his own self,   
for condemning more of the evil in his character. Each student   
developed a running confession, compounded of self-criticisms,   
thought summaries, and extracurricular self-examinations; this was   
a major indicator of his progress in reform. Taking shape both   
orally and in writing, its content became known to other students   
and to cadres and class heads. One's eagerness to reveal himself   
seemed to be more important than any specific thing revealed.   
  
Like the Western prisoners, students vied to outdo each other   
in the frankness, completeness, and luridness of their individual   
confessions: one group would issue a challenge to another to match   
its collective confessions; personal confession became the major   
  
THE REVOLUTIONARY UNIVERSITY   
  
topic of discussion in small group meetings, large student gather-   
ings, informal talks with cadres, articles posted upon bulletin boards,   
and "wall newspapers." Hu had the feeling that everywhere he   
went, he encountered the question, "Have you made your full   
confession?"   
  
In his case, he had little in his past to conceal; indeed, his "pro-   
gressive" record, though he stated it with restraint, was a mark of   
distinction. What troubled him was a "secret" of the immediate   
present, and its consequences for his Communist future. For he   
was becoming obsessed with his own inner antagonism, and the   
dangerous rebel within him — the forrnulator of these obsessive   
thoughts — threatened always to expose the rest of him:   
  
The intensity of my anti-Communist thoughts greatly increased. I de-   
veloped a terrible fear that these thoughts would come out and be   
known to all. But I was determined to prevent this. I tried to appear   
calm, but I was in great inner turmoil. I knew that if I kept quiet no   
one could know this secret which I had not confessed. But people   
were always talking about secrets . . . saying that it was wrong to   
keep secrets, that one had to confess everything. Sometimes during an   
ordinary conversation the cadre or a student would mention secrets,   
and I would feel very disturbed. ... Or we would be called suddenly   
to an informal meeting, and someone would get up and say, "There are   
still some students in the university who remain 'antiorganization'."   
I knew that no one else was thinking of me, but I couldn't help feeling   
very upset. . . . The secret was always something that was trying to   

----------------------- Page 225-----------------------

escape from me.   
  
Part of Hu's "secret" was his growing disillusionment and despair:   
  
I had thought that by entering the revolutionary university I could   
make a new start. Instead of this it had brought me mainly the loss of   
personal liberty. ... I felt disappointed . . . infuriated and disgusted.   
... I had little hope for the future.   
  
Observing the other students around him, Hu felt that all were   
tense and agitated, without necessarily sharing his own response.   
In fact, many of the younger ones — those in their teens and early   
twenties — seemed to be throwing themselves fully, even ecstatically,   
into the reform process, thriving upon their activist frenzy. Others   
a bit older made a great public display of their progressiveness in   
what Hu considered an opportunist fashion, some of them seek-   
ing to compensate for incriminating ties with the old regime in the   
past. But Hu felt that almost everyone in his section who was over   
  
264 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
twenty-five was in conflict about how much of himself to surrender   
to the process.   
  
Students' attitudes toward one another had changed greatly from   
the idyllic togetherness of the earliest days. The sense of common   
purpose had by no means completely disappeared; but the pres-   
sures which everyone was experiencing had converted the small   
group sessions into a complicated blend of eager analysis, cautious   
orthodoxy, covert personal antagonism, and beleaguered co-opera-   
tion.   
  
Hu's own position grew steadily worse. His suppressed resent-   
ment was always just beneath the surface, and on one occasion,   
when he intervened on behalf of a female student in an argument   
with school guards, this resentment exploded openly. Hu was then   
required to make a special self-examination to condemn his mis-   
conduct, his lack of full faith in the Party's representatives, and the   
"individualism" at the bottom of it all. Cadres were no longer   
gentle and therapeutic in their approach to him, but made it clear   
that they considered him stubborn and unco-operative. One of   
them (his old nemesis) began to make indirect threats, implying   
that if his attitude did not improve, his case would be dealt with at   
a public gathering. Hu knew well what this meant; he had witnessed   
three such mass meetings. Two of these had been revivalist-like   
gatherings at which a student with a particularly evil past had been   
given a dramatic (and well-staged) opportunity to redeem him-   
self. Before an audience of 3,000 fellow students, this offender   
gave a lurid description of his misdeeds — political work with the   
Nationalists, spying for the Japanese, anti-Communist activity,   
stealing money from his company, violating his neighbor's daughter   
— followed by an expression of relief at "washing away all of my   

----------------------- Page 226-----------------------

sins" and of gratitude to the government for "helping me to be-   
come a new man." The effect of the meetings had been an inten-   
sification of confession pressures and a widespread feeling that   
whatever one had done was mild by comparison and might as well   
be revealed.   
  
Aware that he was not a likely candidate for this type of display,   
Hu worried about another kind of public exposure: the ultimate   
humiliation of the mass "struggle." He had seen a student con-   
sidered to be a hopelessly "backward element" face an equally large   
audience to be denounced rather than redeemed; faculty members,   
  
THE REVOLUTIONARY UNIVERSITY 265   
  
cadres, and fellow students had embellished upon his "reactionary   
tendencies," his stubborn refusal to change his ways, his failure to   
respond to repeated offers of "help" which all claimed to have made.   
It had been made quite clear that this young man's future in Com-   
munist China was quite precarious, and the ceremony had been a   
grim warning to Hu and other students of questionable standing.   
  
Hu received one additional warning. A Youth Corps member   
personally sympathetic to him told him that his case had been   
critically discussed by cadres at Youth Corps meetings, and that   
he had better be more careful in the future. Hu was moved by   
this show of compassion, realizing that the other student had acted   
at considerable personal risk.   
  
He did become more cautious, and tried to make a better reform   
showing. One of the ways he did this, at the same time finding some   
escape, was to spend as much time as possible alone in the library,   
immersing himself in the only reading material available — Com-   
munist literature. What he learned gave him added authority in   
the group; and the cadre's threats of public exposure were never   
carried out. Hu felt he had also been protected by his progressive   
past, his letter of recommendation from a high Communist official,   
his favorable standing among many of the students, his knowledge   
of Communism, and, perhaps most important, something in his   
character which made the cadres feel that he might be still salvaged   
as an effective Communist worker.   
  
But his added readings, especially of Lenin's works, were also a   
source of anxiety. For he began to realize that what he was ex-   
periencing in thought reform was not, as he had preferred to be-   
lieve, a misapplication of Communist principles, but was in every   
respect consistent with Leninist teachings. He found himself ques-   
tioning the entire Communist structure. He achieved better external   
control; but his inner feelings of hostility, suffocation, and con-   
fusion were more intolerable than ever:   
  
I had a very strong hatred for the Communists and for the whole sys-   
tem. But it was a general kind of feeling and I wasn't sure of its exact   

----------------------- Page 227-----------------------

source. It wasn't directed exclusively against the Communists — but was   
rather vague and diffuse. I was very unhappy about the surroundings;   
everything from all directions was pressing upon me. I couldn't stand   
this pressure and wanted only to get rid of it. It was not a feeling of   
resistance — I just wanted to escape. I felt persecuted and depressed.   
  
266 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
He began to have nightmares and thought he was talking in his   
sleep; he would wake up anxiously, fearing that he might have re-   
vealed his "secret." He was also greatly upset by a suicide which   
occurred during this stage of the reform program (a young student   
had apparently jumped into a well); this student had been a   
Youth Corps member and outwardly an activist, and his death led   
Hu to believe that "he too must have had some hidden secret."   
Two other students had to be sent to mental hospitals, having   
apparently become psychotic. Many other students (Hu estimated   
their number as high as one-third of the student body) by this   
time had visible psychological or psychosomatic symptoms — fatigue,   
insomnia, loss of appetite, vague aches and pains, and upper respira-   
tory or gastrointestinal symptoms. 8 Hu himself suffered from   
fatigue and general malaise. He visited the school doctor, who gave   
him a reform-oriented and psychologically sophisticated diagnosis:   
"There's nothing wrong with your body. It must be your thoughts   
that are sick. You will feel better when you have solved your prob-   
lems and completed your reform." And indeed, he shared with many   
other students a state of painful inner conflict. Yet the contagious   
cacophony of enthusiasm, tension, and fear was still, after five   
months, very much in crescendo.   
  
Final Thought Summary:   
Submission and the New Harmony   
  
The announcement that it was time to begin work on the over-   
all thought summary (or final confession) implied that relief was in   
sight, but it also made clear that this last effort would be the   
crucial one. At a mass meeting, faculty members emphasized the   
importance of the summary as the crystallization of the entire re-   
form experience, the final opportunity for each student to resolve   
his thought problems. For the next two days, small group sessions   
were devoted almost entirely to discussions of the form of the   
summary. It was to be a life history, beginning two generations   
back and extending through the thought reform experience, de-   
scribing, candidly and thoroughly, the development of one's   
thoughts and the relationship of these to actions. It was also to   
analyze the personal effects of thought reform, on one's character   
as well as one's view of the world, including but going beyond what   
  
THE REVOLUTIONARY UNIVERSITY 267   
  
had already been written and discussed in previous thought   
summaries. It would require anywhere from five to twenty-   

----------------------- Page 228-----------------------

five thousand Chinese characters (roughly equivalent to the same   
number of English words); but content was much more important   
than length. And each man's summary had to be approved before   
he could graduate. Rumors circulated among the students of   
"backward elements" having been asked to repeat the entire thought   
reform course, and of "reactionaries" or "enemies of the people"   
sent to prison for reform by labor.   
  
After a ten-day writing period, students read their summaries to   
the small group. They encountered even more prolonged and pene-   
trating criticism than before, since everyone was now required to   
sign each confession read, to signify his approval and his respon-   
sibility for letting it pass. In Hu's group, some students were kept   
under critical fire for several days and wrote many revisions. As   
usual, the students themselves worked upon each other, but cadres   
and faculty members had the final say; they later added their own   
evaluative comments to the thought summaries. The final docu-   
ment then became a permanent part of the student's personal rec-   
ord, and (in the possession of his superiors) accompanied him   
throughout his future career.   
  
Hu, determined to surmount this final hurdle, concentrated upon   
using his theoretical knowledge to produce an acceptable final con-   
fession. He knew that two special emphases were required. The   
first, an analysis of class origin, gave him little difficulty: he could   
readily place his family in the "landlord" or "rural ruling class"   
category, and attribute to this circumstance his own evil character   
traits and false ideas. He called himself an "exploiter," and accused   
himself of "having adopted a stand diametrically opposed to that   
of the people," and having been in the past "actually ... an   
enemy of the people."   
  
But the second requirement was not quite as simple, for it was   
the denunciation of his father, both as an individual and as a   
representative of the old order. This was the ultimate symbolic   
act in the thought reform of young Chinese, and many found it to   
be extremely painful. A cadre noticed that Hu was particularly   
reluctant to criticize his father, and began to prod him about it at   
every opportunity: "He said that the most important part of the   
reform of an intellectual was the denunciation of his father — since   
  
268 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
the intellectual almost invariably comes from a wealthy family   
which must have been anti-Communist, and if he does not de-   
nounce his father he cannot be a faithful citizen of the new regime."   
Hu tried to beg off, claiming that he had retained no clear im-   
pressions because he and his father had been separated during   
much of his childhood. The cadre insisted however that "the father   
is a hero to every small boy," and demanded that Hu take a stand   
for or against him.   
  

----------------------- Page 229-----------------------

Two letters which Hu received from his family home at about   
this time suddenly gave the problem a new tragic dimension. The   
first letter, written by his uncle, carried the disturbing news that   
his father had been publicly "struggled" and then imprisoned dur-   
ing the land reform campaign in Hupeh, and asked Hu to use his   
influence with the Communists to secure his father's release. A   
day or two later, Hu received a second letter, from his father, telling   
that he had been released from prison, but that all of the family   
holdings had been taken from him, and that the family situation   
was still very dangerous. Hu had difficulty describing to me his   
feelings at this time, which were compounded of shock, guilt, and   
anger. At the beginning of land reform, Hu had written to his father   
to urge him to surrender voluntarily most of his land holdings to   
the surrounding peasants, and to co-operate fully with the Com-   
munists in the manner of an "enlightened landlord." The father   
had followed his son's advice; and now Hu felt that they both had   
been deceived. He recalled his last meeting with his father, when   
he had refused to follow his father's advice. He had decided to enter   
the distant University of Nanking, contrary to his father's wishes   
that he choose an institution closer to home; now he kept hearing   
the words of his father's parting admonition:   
  
You young people no longer think of the older generation. Your affec-   
tions towards us must be very light. You do not understand how an old   
man feels about his son. Our affection for you is beyond your compre-   
hension.   
  
We shall see later that these words were less than fair; but this   
did not save Hu from his sense of remorse, and from castigat-   
ing himself for disobeying his father and for not remaining close   
enough to him to be a help in a time of crisis. He began to imagine   
— from descriptions he had heard of land-reform "struggle" meet-   
  
THE REVOLUTIONARY UNIVERSITY 269   
  
ings in the north — the picture of his father being insulted, spat   
upon, beaten, and stoned at the hands of a "people's court." He   
pictured his father imprisoned in chains; he remembered a sordid   
prison he had visited years before, and even more vividly his own   
experience of having been briefly imprisoned by the Nationalists   
because of his anti-government activities as a university student:   
"I relived all of my sufferings through this vision of my father meet-   
ing the same fate." Soon grief gave way to resentment: "I over-   
came my sorrow with my desire for vengeance." He identified him-   
self closely with his father, and saw in both their maltreatment   
evidence of basic Communist hypocrisy and evil:   
  
I began to feel that my father and I, each of us in his own way, were   
enemies to the Communists. My father was old and useless, and was   
therefore persecuted by them. I was young and useful and so the Com-   
munists were still trying to win me. ... I was considered by the other   
students to be an able man. My father enjoyed great respect among the   

----------------------- Page 230-----------------------

peasants of the countryside, and was always generous to them in time   
of need, never the greedy, cruel, heartless landlord, which the Com-   
munists always spoke about. . . . Both my father and I had tried very   
hard to work with the new regime; yet both of us were being victimized.   
I realized that the Communists had no sense of fairness or justice. They   
insisted upon beating down any person who held prestige among those   
around him outside of Party circles, and they would do whatever they   
thought necessary to accomplish this, no matter how "enlightened"   
such people might be concerning Communism. ... I thought of the   
old model I had developed in my mind in the past of a Communist   
ideal state which would give land to the poor, and offer a new solution   
for a corrupt society. But I realized that Communism did not fit this   
ideal, and that the Communist is a very cruel man who uses the poor   
and their resentment against the rich for the purpose of furthering his   
own power.   
  
As he told me these things (and especially when he referred   
to his father) Hu lost his usual composure, sometimes turning   
troubled eyes to the floor, at other times pacing restlessly about the   
room. He seemed more anxious than at any other time during our   
interviews; and at the next session I was told that he had remained   
agitated after our meeting and had insisted upon spending several   
hours alone with the interpreter discussing these same experiences.   
  
Hu said nothing about the two letters to anyone around him in   
the revolutionary university. He found a compromise solution to   
the cadre's demand that he denounce his father by using a tortuous   
  
27O THOUGHT REFORM   
  
form of Communist reasoning: after mentioning his father's   
benevolence to the peasants, he went on to condemn his acts as   
"even more reactionary than the ruthless abuse ... by the vicious   
landlords" because "these good deeds helped to render the posi-   
tion of the ruling class even more unassailable" (a statement which   
echoes Father Luca's remark that, "What you do that is good —   
is bad — precisely because it is good!").   
  
In presenting his own life history, Hu was careful to play down   
his leftist student activities, and even related them critically to the   
"individualism" which was a central theme of the document. Only   
later did he realize how much an expression of personal submission   
this summary was:   
  
It is a report very much against my own will. If you put this final   
thought summary before me now, I could write a new summary contra-   
dictory to it in each sentence. If it isn't fear, what else could push one   
to do something so completely against his own will? If I had not been   
so fearful I should have refused to write something like this.   
  
He could not tell me how much of the summary he believed at   
that time. It included ideas which he did not believe even then,   

----------------------- Page 231-----------------------

others which he believed then but subsequently discarded, and   
still others — as he explains in an eloquent testimony to the power   
of language — so enmeshed in Communist patterns of thought and   
speech as to defy evaluation:   
  
Using the pattern of words for so long, you are so accustomed to them   
that you feel chained. If you make a mistake, you make a mistake   
within the pattern. Although you don't admit that you have adopted   
this kind of ideology, you are actually using it subconsciously, almost   
automatically. ... At that time I believed in certain aspects of their   
principles and theories. But such was the state of confusion in my own   
mind that I couldn't tell or make out what were the things that I did   
believe in.   
  
Hu noticed that after the thought summaries were completed (all   
in his group, and apparently in the other groups as well, were even-   
tually accepted), most of the students seemed to experience a great   
sense of relief. They had passed through their trial and made their   
symbolic submission; and many— especially among the young —   
seemed to feel that a closer bond had been established between   
themselves and the government.   
  
THE REVOLUTIONARY UNIVERSITY 27I   
  
But for Hu there was no great relief and little or any feeling of   
bond. Still depressed and disappointed, his strongest desire was to   
leave the environment as soon as possible. He had previously de-   
cided to return to Nanking — the past scene of happy and success-   
ful days — and seek a job and a way of life (possibly as a school   
teacher) outside the main currents of politics. He had already   
written friends there who had sent him money for the journey.   
Therefore, when students were given cards to fill out to state their   
job preference, Hu paid little attention, and left his card blank —   
preferring to make his own arrangements. His action was con-   
sidered an unfriendly one; it would have been quite different if   
he had indicated no choice and had added a note, as some students   
did, saying that he left the matter entirely up to the govern-   
ment's discretion. A cadre called him in for a talk, and when he   
defended his action on the basis of wishing to become a school-   
teacher in Nanking, he was told, "We can assign you to a school-   
teacher's job, but it would do you good to work in the countryside.   
You have been too long in the big cities, and maybe that is why   
you have not been so activist."   
  
When the job assignment did come through, however, it was as a   
political worker and teacher in an obscure North China military area   
— a kind of assignment generally considered highly undesirable. No   
one was required to accept the job offered him, although most stu-   
dents had little choice, since they were unlikely to find an alternative   
position and they knew that a job refusal would not look well on   
their records. But Hu, without too much logical consideration, did de-   
cide to refuse the assignment — at least at first. Three days later,   

----------------------- Page 232-----------------------

after constant visits from cadres and activists, he reversed himself   
and once more succumbed to the wishes of the authorities. He   
could not say just why he did this, but the implication was clear   
that he wished to make one last effort to fit in with the new regime,   
and hoped that life outside of the revolutionary university might be   
less oppressive. He also stated that the idea of actively fighting   
Communism in the future was already taking shape in his mind,   
and that he considered the job a good opportunity to obtain greater   
firsthand knowledge of Communist procedures. While this second   
reason might well have been an attempt to justify that which he felt   
emotionally impelled to do, it is quite possible that, confused and   
fearful as he was, ideas of adapting himself to Communism and of   
  
272 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
fighting Communism existed simultaneously within him.   
  
All that was left was the graduation ceremony. The first part of   
this was devoted to an admission ritual for new Party members:   
facing a huge photograph of Mao, nine faculty cadres solemnly   
took their oaths, suggesting to the 3,000 students in the audience   
(according to Hu) "the honor, the great difficulty, and the im-   
portance of becoming a Party member." Hu felt that the students   
were almost forgotten in the excitement surrounding the new Party   
members, although faculty representatives and visiting officials   
(there to recruit personnel from among the graduates) did con-   
gratulate the students upon the completion of their thought reform,   
and urge them to continue to follow its principles in their future   
work.   
  
When Hu arrived at his assignment in North China, he was re-   
quired to undergo a two-month training period whose routine,   
except for more rigorous physical training, was not too different   
from that of the revolutionary university. At the end of this train-   
ing, when he was faced with the prospect of accepting a permanent   
assignment with the army, Hu was unwilling to go through with it   
and requested that he be permitted to leave. He had been no hap-   
pier there than at the revolutionary university; he had, in fact, found   
the new cadres under whom he worked to be, if less devious, more   
crude and unpleasant than those he had dealt with during his re-   
form. The antagonisms he had observed between older and   
younger cadres, and between the military authorities and the rural   
peasant population, had confirmed his critical feelings toward the   
regime. In addition, he feared the possible outbreak of war with the   
West, and believed that should this happen his own position   
would become much more dangerous. But most important of all   
perhaps was his reluctance to become involved in any commitment   
to the regime that would make it impossible for him to get away   
in the future.   
  
Communist authorities made strong attempts to get Hu to change   
his mind, but he pleaded failing health and inability, as a south-   

----------------------- Page 233-----------------------

erner, to tolerate the extreme cold (from which he actually did   
suffer) . He was finally permitted to depart, although he was given   
virtually no travel credentials. He headed for Nanking, selling some   
of his belongings to finance the trip. There he found only a few   
positions available, all of which he felt would involve him too   
  
THE REVOLUTIONARY UNIVERSITY 273   
  
closely with the regime. He wished to visit his father in Hupeh;   
but from all he could learn, he decided that it would be much too   
dangerous. After a few weeks in Nanking, he was called for question-   
ing by the police because of his idleness; and he felt it was unsafe   
to remain there. Through friends with whom he was staying he   
discovered that it was possible to leave China by way of the Hong   
Kong border (during early 1950, such travel was still not too diffi-   
cult). He quickly decided to do this; and even an expression of affec-   
tion from a girl he met in Canton (of whom he had been very fond   
during his middle-school days) could not deter him from leaving his   
country and entering the British Crown Colony.   
  
CHAPTER   
  
A CHINESE ODYSSEY   
  
Many of Hu's emotional experiences have a familiar   
ring, since the psychological pressures at a revolu-   
tionary university closely resemble those in a prison. There is the   
assault upon identity, although without any physical brutality;   
the establishment of guilt and shame; a form of self-betrayal; alter-   
nating leniency and harshness; a compulsion to confess; the logical   
dishonoring of re-education; a final confession, elaborate and in-   
clusive rather than terse; and an even greater emphasis upon the   
experience of personal rebirth. There are also important differences,   
such as the development of group intimacy ("the great together-   
ness") before the emotional pressures. But these differences, sig-   
nificant as they are, do not warrant a new step-by-step analysis.   
  
To get at more basic contrasts and more basic underlying prin-   
ciples, we must, as with the Westerners, turn from the process to   
the individual, and follow Hu beyond his thought reform, first   
back over his early years and then through his Hong Kong life. Al-   
though the program which Hu encountered at the revolutionary   
university was typical enough (the other fourteen Chinese sub-   
jects, especially those four who had attended a revolutionary univer -   
sity, confirmed this), his responses were obviously unusual. Why   
was this so? What was there in his background and his character   
which led him to feel as he did? What can his experiences teach   
us of the reform conflicts and life struggles of Chinese intellectuals   
in general?

A CHINESE ODYSSEY 275   
  
Childhood and Youth: Background for Reform   
  
Symbolically enough, Hu's life began in exile. His father had   
been a high-ranking Nationalist official during the early years of the   
Chinese Revolution, and had spent many years in distant assign-   
ments or in flight from his enemies. One of these flights (from the   
forces of Yuan Shi-k'ai, a powerful general who sought to restore   
the monarchy and place himself on the throne) took him to Kansu,   
a remote province in the northwest. There he married Hu's mother,   
a relatively uneducated woman of undistinguished family back-   
ground; and it was there that Hu was born and spent the first four   
years of his life. His only memories of that period were of the   
frightening folk tales which his maternal grandmother told him (of   
owls who carried off bad little boys, and of devils disguised as men   
who, simply by looking at little boys, caused them to disappear)   
and of that same grandmother's unhappiness when Hu and his   
parents left their Kansu home. The themes of fear and unhap-   
piness which appeared first in these recollections recurred frequently   
throughout his reconstruction of his childhood.   
  
When Hu was six years old (the family had spent two years in   
more or less temporary dwellings) Hu was moved to his father's   
family home in Hupeh Province, and he remained there or nearby   
for the next thirteen years. But this move, rather than uniting the   
family, marked the beginning of long separations; his father was   
away most of the time, appearing only on rare occasions, and then   
briefly and often unannounced. Hu senior belonged to a faction   
of the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) which had come into active   
conflict with Chiang Kai-shek, so that he was almost a fugitive.   
  
Hu held a special position in this fatherless household (there was   
an uncle nearby but not in the same compound). He was the   
"young master" being groomed for family leadership, the only   
direct male heir (an older brother and one or two sisters had died   
in infancy). Moreover, Hu's father too had been an oldest son, and   
this placed Hu in the main line of family authority. His family's   
long prominence in the area (his paternal grandfather had been an   
important provincial official during the Ch'ing dynasty), its heri-   
tage of scholarly attainment, the importance of preserving the   
"family name" — all this was impressed upon him. It was a situa-   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
tion which in every way encouraged the development within him   
of precocious self-assertion.   
  
But this celebrated little boy (and no culture has ever made a   
greater fuss over its male children) had a strange rival for power   
within the family: a woman two generations his senior. This "step-   
grandmother" was the bete noire of his childhood, and indeed of   

----------------------- Page 235-----------------------

much of his life. Originally his paternal grandfather's second wife   
(she was not a concubine, as his first wife had died before she   
came into the family), she was the only surviving member of her   
generation. Possessing seniority as well as the ability and will to   
rule, she took full advantage of the family's power vacuum and full   
charge of its affairs. Yet her leadership placed her in a complicated   
position (nothing is ever simple in a Chinese family) — because she   
was a woman, and, more important, because she was unrelated by   
blood to any of the other family members, which, as Hu explained,   
made them regard her as little more than a concubine. She had   
borne a male child — always a matter of great prestige for a Chinese   
woman — who had been kidnapped by bandits and never returned.   
This, according to Hu, was another source of tension, as she had   
become embittered by this incident, and resented "the family"   
for not making strong enough efforts (possibly not paying a large   
enough ransom) to get the child back. Hu felt that she extracted   
her revenge through her tyrannical reign over the household, to the   
point where she became "a saboteur of the family." Although the   
others chafed under her domination, she was acting within Chinese   
tradition, and no one had the courage or the sanction to contest   
her. Indeed, Hu's uncle (his father's younger brother), the only   
person around who might have offered resistance, preferred to move   
out from her control at the time of his marriage rather than follow   
the more conventional pattern of bringing his bride back to the main   
family home.   
  
Hu believed that, as the "young master," he was the special target   
of her abuse. She became for him a symbol of the "old," and a   
special object of his hatred, a hatred which was not, however,   
devoid of respect:   
  
She was a woman of the old China. She was tall, very tall and impres-   
sive looking. She had bound feet. She was a very able and intelligent   
woman. . . . She could be very eloquent, convincing to others, but   
she was stubborn and couldn't be talked into anything herself. . . .   
  
A CHINESE ODYSSEY 277   
  
She never liked me, and was very jealous of my position in the family.   
I could always feel her antagonism in the atmosphere, but she was   
much too shrewd to mistreat me in a direct manner. She never beat me   
physically. ... It was in a glance or a phrase directed at me that I   
could feel it. ... I hated her so much that at times I felt that I could   
not stand her.   
  
The conflict between the old woman and the boy reached its   
climax when he was ten years old through what began as a seem-   
ingly inconsequential incident but grew into an event of major   
proportions:   
  
One day someone was telling a story before a gathering of our family   
members. The story was very unfavorable to the head of the household.   

----------------------- Page 236-----------------------

It described how he had misused family funds and cheated the other   
members of the family. After listening for a while I said, "That man is   
a thief!" My grandmother then spoke up with great emotion and said,   
"He is saying this about me, that I am not honest, that I am corrupt."   
She immediately called all the family members into the hall of the an-   
cestors, the family shrine, and in a very dramatic fashion she lit up all   
of the candles that were in the room. Then she said, "The young master   
has accused me of being dishonest. I will pray to my ancestors to be   
more honest." Other relatives attempted to calm her down, saying that   
I was only a boy and that she should accept an apology from me. But   
she refused to do this, saying, "No, I am not worthy of his apology. I   
am just a poor old servant of the family." She maintained this attitude   
very stubbornly, and nothing that anybody said to her could convince   
her to change her mind.   
  
Her actions, in effect, forced Hu to leave the family home, since   
this kind of conflict within a Chinese family cannot remain openly   
unresolved. As Hu explained:   
  
This was really a skillful way to squeeze me out of the household. With   
her refusal to accept my apology, my only recourse was to leave. But it   
was done so cleverly within the framework of tradition that no one   
could accuse her of acting wrongly. . . . She was not treating me as a   
grandson or as a little boy, but rather as the legal heir, as if she were   
dealing with my father.   
  
It is quite possible, of course, that Hu did more to provoke these   
actions than his version of the story suggests. Or even if he did not,   
it is likely that the step-grandmother accurately perceived that Hu   
was expressing indirect hostility toward her. In any case, his out-   
burst could have been considered a sign of disrespect for his elders.   
  
278 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
In most situations like this, an apology from the youthful offender   
would have ended the matter — and Hu is right in perceiving that   
his step-grandmother's show of humility was really a highly-charged   
form of aggressiveness. Although cleverly correct in her forms,   
however, she could have been criticized for a lack of spirit of com-   
promise, an important virtue in traditional Chinese culture. Such   
bitter animosity, kept well beneath the surface, occurred in many   
Chinese families.   
  
In Hu's family, external forms were still maintained. Although   
he went to live in his uncle's house nearby and visited his family   
home infrequently, it was still necessary for him to appear on   
special occasions — for instance, the Chinese New Year celebration   
— to pay his respects to his step-grandmother through the tradi-   
tional symbol of submissive reverence, the k'o-t'ou. He dreaded   
these visits long in advance, but it was made clear to him that he   
had no choice in the matter because "if I did not, I would be con-   
demned by all society." His step-grandmother, on each such occa-   

----------------------- Page 237-----------------------

sion, maintained her "humility" and perpetuated the conflict by   
declaring herself "unworthy" of the salutation.   
  
Hu's mother, rather than offering him protection against the   
step-grandmother, was herself another victim. Cowed and power-   
less before her elder, she was so looked down on as a "common   
woman" from a backward province, that even the servants treated   
her badly. Sickly, nervous, and resentful of her husband's continued   
absence, she often had to turn over her son's care to others. Hu   
remembers her with some fondness, but also recalls that she some-   
times took her frustrations out on him and subjected him to beat-   
ings. She died when Hu was fourteen years old, and was in many   
ways an even more distant figure ("I never experienced the intimacy   
of a mother with her" ) than his absent father.   
  
For to Hu, his father soon became the center of a lasting   
personal myth — that of the all-powerful father who suddenly   
materializes and rescues his son from an otherwise invincible   
oppressor r   
  
I found myself always thinking of him. ... To me he was the most   
dignified and impressive man in the world. ... I felt that one day   
my father would return and all of my troubles would be over.   
  
Nor could repeated evidence to the contrary dispel this myth:   
the family lost touch with his father for periods of years, and   
  
A CHINESE ODYSSEY 279   
  
when he did visit, the step-grandmother and he observed all proper   
forms (he too had to be filial) and things remained as they had   
been. Hu was never too happy at his uncle's house, where he felt   
he was being cared for more out of obligation than love, and he   
went on hoping; when he got tired of this his thoughts turned   
toward revenge, and toward the day when he would be big enough   
and smart enough to be able to deal with his arch-enemy. Her death,   
which occurred shortly after that of his mother, and his father's   
continued absence caused him to avoid the family home, which he   
then considered haunted.   
  
Hu's erratic pattern of education exposed him to the full chaos   
of the Chinese cultural and political scene. From the ages of eight   
to twelve, he studied with private tutors employed by his and   
neighboring families; in the traditional fashion, he learned how to   
read and write from simplified versions of the Confucian classics.   
He did not like the stern discipline of the tutor, and was frequently   
punished for misbehavior; but he was impressed with Confucian   
teachings of filial piety and loyalty to family and country, as yet   
unaware of the inconsistencies between these theoretical virtues and   
the realities of the life around him.   
  
Next, he spent two years studying and boarding at a new-style   

----------------------- Page 238-----------------------

upper primary school not too far from his home. There he was   
surprised to encounter classmates who were mostly adults or near-   
adults, prospective employees of the local government who had   
come to take advantage of the school's "modern" curriculum, in   
keeping with a new regulation that officials have some Western   
education. As the youngest pupil in the school, Hu deeply resented   
the teasing and bullying he received from the others, some of them   
two or three times his age — especially when they told him that "a   
little boy is not supposed to lose his temper with his elders." He   
no doubt stimulated many of these antagonisms, since by this   
time he had become a rebellious, outspoken child. Again made   
aware of his helplessness in the face of superior power, he once   
more dreamed of the day when he could outwit his tormentors; he   
partially realized this goal in demonstrating his quicker ability to   
grasp the Western subjects in the academic curriculum.   
  
After his graduation, his uncle planned to send him to a junior   
middle school in a nearby city. Just when Hu was about to leave for   
the new school, his father suddenly appeared, and Hu took advan-   
  
280 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
tage of the occasion to express many of his grievances. His father   
was angered by the boy's story. As a man of the world, he disap-   
proved of the provincial way in which Hu was dressed, and of the   
undistinguished school which had been selected for him. As usual,   
Hu senior stayed only briefly, but before he left he canceled the   
existing plans and promised to return soon to take the boy to a   
better school in a larger city. For the next three years, however,   
nothing more was heard from him; and between the ages of thirteen   
and sixteen Hu remained idle, receiving no formal education.   
  
These years were the most lonely interlude of a life in which   
loneliness had already become a regular feature. Hu felt estranged   
from his uncle as well as his father, since the uncle resented both   
the boy and the father for undermining what he considered to be a   
reasonable discharge of his responsibilities. Hu became more em-   
bittered than ever — angry at his uncle for allowing family conflicts   
to interfere with his education, and even having doubts about his   
father and wondering whether he was really in hiding or had "just   
forgotten about the family." But he clung tenaciously to his father-   
return myth, and even when he was telling me about these events,   
he could admit no resentment toward his mythical hero. Feeling at   
home nowhere, thinking a great deal about running away, but   
unable to decide where to go, he described his general emotion as   
"fatalistic anger" (the kind of hostility which is temporarily held   
in abeyance until an opportunity arises to express it).   
  
Finally dismissing the entire problem from his mind, Hu began   
to interest himself in other things — taking long walks through the   
neighboring countryside, and reading voraciously the traditional   
Chinese chien-hsia novels. The chien-hsia is a superhuman hero   

----------------------- Page 239-----------------------

who combines physical strength and magical powers in purishing   
evil and helping the oppressed, always acting outside of and fre-   
quently in opposition to vested authority; so great is the chien-hsia's   
imaginative impact that one Chinese colleague — possibly with a   
certain amount of cultural chauvinism — described him to me as "a   
combination of the Western knight errant and Robin Hood, only   
much more skillful and ingenious." Imagining himself a chien-hsia   
was an ideal antidote to Hu's sense of loneliness and helplessness.   
His period of inactivity came to an end only through the chance   
appearance of an old family friend who prevailed upon the uncle   
to send Hu back to school (respected outsiders have frequently   
  
A CHINESE ODYSSEY 281   
  
been the best mediators in severe Chinese intrafamily disputes).   
  
Hu was then sent to a middle school sponsored by the Kuomintang   
Youth Corps. He spent just one semester there, but it was an ex-   
perience which had great significance in shaping his political emo-   
tions. He had chosen the school himself, for even in his isola-   
tion he had been caught up in the wave of patriotism which swept   
the country at the time of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War.   
But he was horrified by what he found there. Hastily put together,   
the school had enrolled many more students than the small faculty   
could handle; the academic program was practically nonexistent,   
and most of the time was devoted to military training. Discipline   
was not only strict, but needlessly vindictive, and severe whippings   
were administered for minor infractions. Hu was from the beginning   
critical of the school and suspicious of its attempts to mobilize   
student emotions — so much so that he was among the very few   
who did not, in the initial burst of patriotic fervor, join the KMT   
Youth Corps. He later told me that his restraint might have been   
due to memories of his father's tribulations within the KMT.   
Students soon became united in their resentment of the school   
and so rebellious that the atmosphere began to resemble that of an   
armed camp; none of the twenty youths from Hu's area returned the   
following semester. While there, Hu, developed his talent for   
rebellion a bit further: he became an expert at forging the signa-   
ture of the chief military trainer on passes (he proudly demon-   
strated his technique to me during our interview). The experience   
left him with the feeling that the KMT Youth Corps was "dis-   
appointing and silly . . . brutal and irrational." His "disgust and   
hatred" was soon extended to the entire KMT Party and Govern-   
ment, and it later developed into the predominating passion of   
his youth.   
  
The county junior middle school to which he transferred seemed   
a great improvement. He did well academically, and quickly be-   
came a leader among the students. In addition, he held a specially   
privileged status among the faculty because the president of the   
school was Hu's uncle's "adopted son" — that is, the uncle, as a   
prominent person in the area, sponsored the school official's career   

----------------------- Page 240-----------------------

and exercised considerable influence over it. This made things   
particularly complicated for Hu when, just a few months after his   
arrival, he came into direct conflict with this same school president.   
  
282 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
For when the students began to notice that their meals seemed   
meager, and suspected some form of corruption in connection with   
the school's rice supply, they turned to Hu to direct an investigation.   
This was an extremely serious situation: the rice kept in the school   
storehouse represented the institution's capital, since rice was the   
only stable currency available; students' tuition fees and teachers'   
salaries were both paid in it, and it was used to buy other foods and   
supplies. Since teachers were badly underpaid, irregularities were   
not infrequent, and sometimes were even considered customary.   
  
Before long, Hu had organized a special committee of students   
to keep a close watch over every grain of rice brought to or taken   
from the storehouse. The system worked admirably: corruption   
apparently ended, and meals improved. But the school president   
was angered by the students' assumption of authority, and especially   
resented Hu as their ringleader. Matters came to a climax when   
an old school servant, despite official permission from the school   
accountant, was refused rice for a late meal upon returning from a   
trip; the student committee members insisted that he first had to   
get Hu's personal approval. Hu soon became involved in a power   
struggle with the school president, which he described to me with   
some relish; it was eventually resolved through a tacit compromise   
in which the students continued their vigilance, but did so as   
quietly as possible in order to cause minimal embarrassment to the   
authorities.   
  
Hu's sense of victory was eventually reinforced by his uncle's   
grudging praise. The latter was at first enraged when informed of   
Hu's activities by the school president; but after a short time, his   
respect for Hu became apparent, and he referred to him as a   
"straight-boned boy" — an expression suggesting strength, courage,   
and integrity. The only unfavorable repercussion came about a year   
later when, despite having announced that Hu had won the prize   
for the outstanding student of the semester, the faculty members   
"forgot" to present the award to him. He became angered, ceased   
making his best efforts, and concluded that "people never get what   
they deserve."   
  
His personal struggles with authority thus found effective social   
expression in the turbulent Chinese student world. His rebellious   
urges were constantly fed by real injustice, until

I developed the conviction that any authority held over me was irra-   
tional. I transferred from school to school. ... As soon as I would   

----------------------- Page 241-----------------------

meet the head of a new school, I would automatically think: "This man   
must be an irrational authority." And I would invariably find out that   
this was true.   
  
There was another rice incident at the provincial upper middle   
school which Hu next attended. This time he was in danger of   
being expelled, until the approaching Japanese armies interrupted   
his personal battle. Hu fled to Free China in the interior, as all   
students were urged to do. His uncle sent him off with these words:   
"When the whole society is so corrupt, what can you, just an   
individual person, do about it?" — an attitude of resignation which   
Hu strongly contested at the time, but one which he was never to   
stop wondering about.   
  
Arriving in Chungking, where students were instructed to report   
for reassignment, Hu got into an argument with an arrogant official   
who reprimanded him for not having the correct papers. He later   
felt that this dispute caused him extra months of waiting and re-   
sulted in his receiving an undesirable school placement to a poorly-   
organized agricultural institution.   
  
Now he became extremely discouraged. He had sustained himself   
through a difficult trip to Chungking with the belief that "every-   
thing would be all right when I got there," but found instead that   
"it was only the beginning of my troubles." Out of touch with his   
family, financially destitute (and cheated when he sold his only   
valuable possession, a gold ring), feeling awkward in imposing upon   
family contacts for temporary shelter, Hu found solace in a new   
friendship. A sympathetic middle-aged scholar and former govern-   
ment official from his own village area offered him the first mean-   
ingful explanation of his sufferings, and became his first political   
mentor:   
  
He was a man about the age of my father, an extremely eloquent per-   
son who quickly became my hero. He told me how he had worked with   
the KMT during its real revolutionary days, but was now being dis-   
criminated against because of his leftist views. I too had felt discrimi-   
nated against as a child and he told me that this was due to the evils   
of the old society. I could see little hope for the future, but then he   
described the Communist program as a solution for China and a way   
  
284 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
to a bright future. ... He was kind and encouraging. I visited him   
frequently and soon adopted his views.   
  
Hu's new beliefs gave him further confidence in his participation   
iri student agitation about corruption in the food supply as well as   
other issues at the agricultural school. And for the first time he be-   
came involved in a dangerous predicament: Nationalist secret police   
arrested some of the students, and Hu was accused by school   
authorities of being a Communist although he had no such affilia-   

----------------------- Page 242-----------------------

tion at the time other than his beginning sympathies. Since he had   
heard stories of cruelty and torture inflicted by this division of the   
KMT, and of special "training" to which alleged offenders had been   
submitted, he decided to flee rather than risk arrest.   
  
Having no place to go, and wishing to contribute to China's war   
effort, he enlisted in a special student military unit then being   
formed. There he found temporary sanctuary, but was once more   
deeply disturbed by the enormous corruption and inefficiency re-   
garding payrolls, allocation of weapons, and training arrangements.   
These things were not unique at the time, but the student unit   
apparently became something of a national scandal. At this time   
his father and uncle succeeded in getting in touch with him again   
and were horrified to find he was in the army; they wrote that they   
had sent him to the interior to become a scholar, not a soldier,   
and that, as the only male of his generation in the family, he had   
no right to take such liberties with his person. Their attitude can be   
summed up in the popular Chinese proverb which Hu himself   
quoted to me: "Good iron is not used for nails; good men do not be-   
come soldiers." Hu resigned after six months of service when he   
was given the chance; he had come to the conclusion that "there   
could be no hope for the Nationalist government."   
  
A veteran enthusiast-cynic at nineteen, Hu's fortunes now finally   
changed. He managed through friends to gain admission to a much-   
respected high school primarily for overseas Chinese from south-   
east Asia, but which took some students in Hu's displaced cir-   
cumstances. When the school had to disband because of a new   
Japanese penetration, Hu accompanied a group of students and   
faculty members to Szechwan Province where it was re-established   
in combination with another school. Hu encountered here, despite   
the limited physical facilities, an atmosphere unique in his ex-   
perience: complete absence of corruption, great intellectual stimula-   
  
A CHINESE ODYSSEY 285   
  
tion, an intimate group life among students, informal relations   
with faculty, and a generally shared hope for future reforms which   
could cure China's ills. In an inspiring history teacher, Hu found his   
second political (and Marxist) mentor:   
  
I already had an emotional sympathy for the Communists. I now began   
to read about the materialist interpretation of history, the history of   
the development of society, and Ai Ssu-chTs popular philosophy. 1 When   
I had difficulty understanding some of these principles I went to this   
history teacher for help. He was always friendly and patient, and seemed   
to answer my questions logically. I acquired the theoretical background   
to go along with my emotional sympathy. . . . From that time on I   
developed the idea in my mind that Communism was the inevitable   
outcome of history. ... It seemed to be the only way out for young   
people.   
  

----------------------- Page 243-----------------------

He emphasized the importance of his resentment of the old   
regime in bringing about this new view of the world.   
  
My main feeling then was hatred for the KMT. All that I had seen and   
experienced was wrong. This hatred was the active side of my being;   
my feeling for Communism was a more passive side. Before I could   
understand the true meaning of their writing I accepted them because   
I was predisposed to do so. ... I was at first excited by their solution   
to China's problems. Then I had more of the feeling that it was all   
settled: the KMT was out of the question, of no use, and Communism   
was the right way.   
  
This was for Hu, "the happiest period of my life," the only time   
he can remember — perhaps with some retrospective glorification   
— being free of disturbing conflicts: "I no longer thought of any of   
my troubles. ... I just forgot about the family." Graduating near   
the top of his class at the age of twenty-one, he left for his home   
shortly after the Japanese surrender.   
  
But when he arrived in Hupeh, he found his father, at sixty, "a   
defeated, frustrated, lonely old man, disillusioned with world   
events." Hu senior had by this time become convinced that man's   
earthly efforts were futile, and (following a frequent Chinese life   
pattern) wished to spend his declining years in Buddhist medita-   
tion. Hu found his father surprisingly approachable and affectionate,   
and the two became closer than at any previous time. There was   
just one conflict between them — the old sore spot of Hu's educa-   
  
286 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
tion. His father, drawing upon his own experience, even went so   
far as to discourage university studies: "I have studied and tried to   
serve my country all my life and what did it lead to?" This failing,   
he urged Hu to attend a nearby university. But Hu recalled his   
past frustrations over his father's failure to keep his word about   
arrangements for study, and at that moment "the old resentment   
returned." He refused his father's request and entered the Univer-   
sity of Nanking, where he felt he could get a better education.   
  
Majoring in law and government, he found the atmosphere not   
conducive to study. Students and faculty members were vehemently   
denouncing the postwar KMT government, especially its failure to   
curb inflation and its repressive methods in attempting to stamp   
out opposition. Before long Hu assumed a leading role in student   
agitation, working closely with Communist Party members who did   
much of the behind-the-scenes organizing. During his junior year,   
he was arrested by the KMT police as part of a general roundup of   
student "activists." Most were soon released, but a small group,   
including Hu, were taken to a country house just outside of Nan-   
king where they were told they were to be secretly executed. Im-   
prisoned for several months, Hu claimed that a spirit of group   
dedication protected him from fear. In fact, his description of the   

----------------------- Page 244-----------------------

experience — even if the words are not taken at complete face value   
— implies a genuine exhilaration:   
  
We were there together and had no horror of death. We always tried   
to encourage each other. . . . We felt that we were being sacrificed   
for a great cause, that our deaths would have a purpose. . . . Some of   
us felt that we were so young and our greatest regret was that we could   
not do more work for China. ... I did feel grief and sorrow at night   
when I would think of my parents and my family. Then I would think   
of the meaning of our sacrifice, and I would forget about my sorrow.   
  
All agreed that the meaning of their sacrifice was its contribu-   
tion to China's future, but Hu recalls a certain amount of dis-   
agreement among the imprisoned students concerning just what   
that future should be. Hu and a few of the others believed that   
China's civil war would be best resolved through a coalition govern-   
ment including the more enlightened Nationalist leaders (who had   
just replaced Chiang Kai -shek) as well as Communists; but the   
Communist students in the group insisted that there must be   
  
A CHINESE ODYSSEY 287   
  
nothing short of a complete Communist victory. Their position   
made Hu wonder whether these students "had greater loyalties   
to the Communist party than to China itself," although not until   
later did he recognize the significance of this disagreement. Hu was   
not too excited (there was a suggestion that one side of him might   
even have been disappointed) when a general amnesty for political   
prisoners led to their release. His main preoccupation at the time   
was that of smuggling out his handcuffs in order to retain them as   
evidence of his mistreatment at the hands of the KMT. When he   
returned to the campus, he was greeted as a hero, and he remained   
active until the Communist entry a few months later.   
  
Evaluation and Follow-up   
  
Hu brought to thought reform an extraordinary capacity for anger   
and indignation; indeed, these had long before become the leitmotif   
of his existence. More than merely expressing them himself, he   
excelled at mobilizing similar emotions among others in his im-   
mediate environment. In this ability lay his capacity for leader-   
ship and the core of his youthful identity as an activist student   
leader. Behind his indignation and his leadership was an unusual   
degree of totalism — an all-or-nothing quality which pervaded his   
emotional life.   
  
Hu's character in some ways was more reminiscent of the spirit   
of the young Martin Luther than of that of Confucius. Like Luther's   
(and like many figures in the Old Testament), Hu's totalism de-   
manded both full authority over those he led, and absolute self-   
surrender to a higher authority. Hu also possessed a conscience of   
terrifying proportions. This kind of conscience can serve the creative   

----------------------- Page 245-----------------------

function of inspiring total sincerity and absolute integrity — of mak-   
ing men mean what they say; it also, in its uncompromising judg-   
ments, contains the potential for the most extreme form of destruc-   
tiveness, including self-destructiveness. 2   
  
We could consider Hu a psychological misfit, a compulsive rebel   
who goes into battle at the mere sight of authority, any authority.   
We could also see him as one of those exceptional young leaders   
who learn early in life to harness their own emotions in such a way   
that they make sensitive contact with yearnings of less intense   
people around them. Both of these judgments are true; either one   
  
288 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
alone distorts the picture. We can certainly say that Hu had little of   
the spirit of compromise and moderation so long valued in Chinese   
character structure; rather, he was an extremist who grew up in a   
series of environments conducive to extremism. This made him no   
less Chinese, but Chinese in a twentieth-century fashion. To under-   
stand the complexities of his character and of his response to   
thought reform, we must examine the strengths and the under-   
lying conflicts in an identity shaped against a background of chaos   
and change.   
  
Whatever his struggles, Hu carried with him from early life a   
strong sense of himself as an aristocrat and a potential leader. As a   
young master within Chinese tradition, he was a little adult groomed   
for authority almost from birth. Moving from his family out into   
society, he maintained the conviction that it was his destiny to   
speak and act on behalf of others, and he developed an early talent   
for doing so. As with any talent, one must avoid oversimplified   
cause-and-effect explanations of origin (hereditary factors are prob-   
ably of great importance); but once this talent had been combined   
with the identity of the aristocratic leader, a pattern of strength   
and bold self-expression emerged which was crucial for what Hu   
would do and be in any situation. His development into a straight-   
boned boy (the last honorable confirmation he received within the   
idiom of traditional Chinese culture) expressed a similar self-image,   
matured to the point where he had become a youth with a cause.   
Both the youth and the cause continued to evolve until Hu became   
the activist student leader. This elite identity sequence supplied Hu   
with a sense of inner continuity, even when he turned against the   
traditional Chinese culture which had originally nurtured it. He   
used the strength of his family heritage — his identification with his   
father and his grandfather — to do battle with that same heritage,   
or at least with its remnants.   
  
At the same time, Hu had always to fight off a profound sense of   
despair growing out of his personal, social, and historical predica-   
ment. Hu's environment had imposed on him a series of painful   
inner contradictions. To be a young master had its advantages; but   
it also involved him in a premature power struggle from which no   

----------------------- Page 246-----------------------

child could emerge unscarred. It was, moreover, an archaic identity,   
one which was based upon a system of values in human relationships   
which was rapidly breaking down. Indeed, the extremes of behavior   
  
A CHINESE ODYSSEY 289   
  
in Hu's family (especially that of his step-grandmother) were des-   
perate attempts to hold on to what was already slipping away. Hu's   
childhood environment was thus a caricature of Chinese family   
life, an expression of traditionalism rather than tradition.   
  
A young master was also expected to be a filial son — obedient   
and proper not from coercion but love. Yet, so lacking in love and   
trust was his family environment that any such an identity had to   
be more pseudo than real. Hu's step-grandmother's indirect aggres-   
siveness, his mother's harassed nervousness, his uncle's petulance   
— and perhaps something inherent in Hu which made him difficult   
to love — all contributed to this contradictory atmosphere. These   
circumstances were both partly created and strongly intensified by   
historical and political currents: his father's fugitive status brought   
about a marriage with inevitable class strains, and was also respon-   
sible for the step-grandmother's being permitted to abuse her   
matriarchal power. Hu had no choice but to go through the filial   
motions; and even though he faltered at an early age (in the family   
shrine incident, for instance), he submitted to his step-grandmother   
more than he could comfortably admit to me.   
  
This submission to his hated adversary had a lasting symbolic   
meaning for Hu: it established within him an exaggerated sensi-   
tivity toward being controlled or dominated by anyone. It also con-   
tributed to his later yearning for the very thing he was always fight-   
ing off: total domination, if not by a strong individual, at least by a   
mystical force. Children subjected to unusually controlling family   
authority can come to depend upon and even find pleasure in being   
so controlled; their subsequent struggle against new, would-be con-   
trollers becomes an inner battle between fear and desire. In Hu's   
case, the controlling person (his grandmother) became a symbol of   
both "irrational authority" and "the past," so that the two became   
equated in his mind. This is a frequent association for a youth in   
any culture, but is especially strong when he grows up in the midst   
of crumbling institutions and abused family prerogatives. Yet, iron-   
ically enough, this step-grandmother also supplied Hu with a model   
for his own later domineering tendencies, and initiated a response   
by which Hu came to view almost every relationship as essentially   
a power struggle.   
  
Rather than the filial son, Hu regarded himself as the abandoned   
and betrayed victim of the most gross injustice. Whom did he   
  
290 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
blame for this injustice? He made clear that he focused most of his   

----------------------- Page 247-----------------------

conscious hostility on his step-grandmother; and she thus served a   
useful function for him as the first of his total villains, acceptable   
outlets for his hatred against whom he could rally real or imagined   
action. But Hu also experienced resentment toward another person,   
for whom such resentment was entirely unacceptable: his father.   
He could not quite suppress the hostility which accompanied his   
sense of having been abandoned; and hostility toward one's father   
is, by traditional Chinese cultural standards, the most unfilial emo-   
tion a child can experience. These resentful feelings were Hu's first   
painful secret. Certainly his desire for revenge against his step-   
grandmother was real enough; but it was intensified by his need to   
purge his mind of similar feelings toward his father, and possibly   
his mother as well. His sense of himself as the unfilial son (to both   
father and grandmother), as the abandoned and betrayed victim,   
and as the avenger made up a formidable negative identity complex.   
Each of these elements was something against which his culture and   
family had warned him, and each was something he could not avoid   
becoming, despite and partly because of this warning; in lasting   
combination, they had the destructive effect of maintaining within   
him the bitterness and guilt which gave his rebellion its desperate   
and compulsive character.   
  
To bring all these aspects of himself — positive and negative —   
into effective combination, Hu resorted to two personal, Utopian   
myths. (The term personal myth is used here to suggest a recur-   
rently-imagined sequence of events which supply purpose and mo-   
mentum to an individual's existence.) The first myth, involving   
his father's return, was mostly passive — a longing for a golden age   
which had never existed. The second, the myth of himself as the   
hero (or chien hsia), was more active, and for a time he lived it   
out quite effectively. These two myths assumed tremendous im-   
portance in Hu's life, for they were the antidote for his despair: the   
first offered hope eternal, the second a bold life of self-sacrifice and   
redemption. At the same time they generated strong emotional   
forces which, once initiated, had a staying power of their own. His   
quests for some form of golden age and for perpetual heroic ex-   
pression 3 came to influence Hu's every action. They also reinforced   
his already well-developed totalism: for so deep had been his   
despair, so strong his sense of personal oppression, so extreme the   
  
A CHINESE ODYSSEY 291   
  
social chaos, and so dramatic the contemporary historical events,   
that Hu began very early to seek all-embracing personal and polit-   
ical solutions.   
  
As an activist student leader in a turbulent student movement,   
Hu found an ideal metier for acting upon his personal myths and   
giving expression to his talents and his emotional urges. Embracing   
a Communist ideology which promised a universal golden age, he   
could remain sufficiently independent to follow a hero's path of   
individual leadership, and almost martyrdom.   

----------------------- Page 248-----------------------

  
He required a new total villain, a role for which the KMT was   
admirably suited. It was "old"; and — on the basis of his own ex-   
perience, beginning with the Youth Corps school — its authority   
was "irrational." These judgments were by no means simply the   
product of Hu's own emotional urges (the KMTs inept and re-   
pressive policies have been widely documented): but Hu — like   
many others of his generation — found in this regime a focus for all   
of the bitterness, anger, and frustration which had built up during   
his young life.   
  
Hu was helped to make the short step from hatred of the KMT   
to sympathy for the Communists (and the feeling he had found   
something "new" and "rational") by the two fatherly men he en-   
countered. One may say that they were, at least temporarily, fathers   
regained; but their attraction for Hu lay in the contrasts between   
them and his real father: they were there, they were consistent, they   
had time for him, and they explained things. Indeed, they did what   
mentors and healers (religious, political, academic, or psychological)   
so often do; they made it possible for Hu to unite his personal   
myths with more sweeping social and historical myths, and pointed   
out to him a way to a relationship with mankind. This new ideology   
was as totalistic as he could wish it to be; and his most vengeful   
feelings could be justified within a framework of an apocalyptic   
cause.   
  
Once Communism became the prevailing authority, however, Hu   
was bound to be troubled by the manipulations of its cadres. First at   
the university, and then during thought reform itself, he experi-   
enced a profound sense of humiliation at being forced to submit to   
suffocating domination. And as in the past, much of his emotional   
energy was taken up with fighting off his own urge to surrender   
himself totally to the force imposing this domination. His entering   
  
292 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
the revolutionary university was in itself a partial admission that   
something in his attitude should be changed; during the first days of   
reform he seemed to be giving himself completely to the process,   
and recapturing that golden age of total sincerity and harmony   
which he had known just once before at his last high school. But as   
much as part of him longed for total emotional immersion, he was,   
in the long run, incapable of it. As with Father Simon (the con-   
verted Jesuit), the defier in Hu could never allow the convert in   
him to gain the upper hand; he could not trust any environment,   
even a Communist one, sufficiently to permit himself the absolute   
merger toward which his totalism constantly drove him.   
  
Hu's means of dealing with this conflict was to cling tenaciously   
to a sense of autonomy, and the only kind of autonomy he knew   
was that of the leader or hero. Hence his unsolicited debate with   
the cadre, and his view of himself as both a teacher and a defender   

----------------------- Page 249-----------------------

of his fellow students. His heroic self-image required him to main-   
tain high standards of integrity (even if he violated these more   
than he admits); and it gave a dramatic quality to his every action,   
a sense that all he did or said had significance not only for himself   
but for the world at large. It was thus of great help in maintaining   
his self-respect and his autonomy, and in preserving a certain amount   
of independence from the bizarre thought-reform morality. But in   
the face of thought reform's consistent antipathy to heroes — to any-   
one who might exert a strong influence over others which was dif-   
ferent from the immediate thought reform message — this self-image   
also imposed an extremely heavy psychological burden.   
  
The greatest threat to Hu's emotional balance, however, was his   
"secret" — the bitter hatred toward the Communist reformers which   
welled up within him. Contained within this secret were all of his   
negative identity elements, which now had a confused relationship   
to the Communist authorities. That is, Hu felt himself to be un-   
filial to a movement he had long embraced and to an all-powerful   
authority which would brook no disloyalty; to be the abandoned and   
betrayed victim of that same Communist authority; and to be a   
potential avenger who would some day smite down his persecutors.   
These sentiments not only would have placed him in considerable   
personal danger had they become known; but their unacceptability   
— to the environment and to Hu himself — stimulated strong feel-   
ings of guilt, just as his secret resentment of his father had earlier   
  
A CHINESE ODYSSEY   
  
in his life. This guilt was partly responsible for Hu's unconscious   
urge to reveal his secret ("The secret was something which was al-   
ways trying to escape from me"). But also contributing to this urge   
was his strong inner drive toward total self-surrender, since reveal-   
ing the extent of his hostility would have been the first step in a   
genuine Communist-style reform. As is so often the case in totalitar-   
ian confession and reform procedures, Hu's secret was almost his   
undoing.   
  
The news of his father's imprisonment caused him to revert sud-   
denly to traditional self-judgments, and to revive his long -standing   
negative self-image of the unfilial son. He experienced the terrible   
guilt of the son who had defied and, by participating in the Com-   
munist movement, had overthrown — had symbolically demolished   
— his father. After this, the requirement that he denounce his   
father in the final summary added salt to his wounds. What is   
puzzling is not that he made this denunciation, since it was a re-   
quirement which no one could escape, but that he subsequently de-   
cided to accept the Communist job assignment and give up his plan   
to flee to Nanking. He did this despite having closely identified with   
his father as a victim of Communist persecution, and having be-   
come, if possible, even more resentful toward the new regime. I   
believe the explanation lies in what I have called the bond of   
betrayal between reformers and reformed. With so strong a sense of   

----------------------- Page 250-----------------------

having betrayed his own filial heritage (a heritage of immense emo-   
tional power, whatever its inconsistencies, and however long his   
defiance of it), he was all the more involved with those who had   
brought about the betrayal, and there was no turning back. Not   
until he actually found himself in the job situation, and had perhaps   
recovered from the shock and depression which had accompanied   
the news of his father's imprisonment, did he realize he was in-   
capable of even the minimal amount of submission necessary to   
survive within the Communist environment.   
  
Why did Hu leave China? Should his defection be attributed to   
courageous resistance to coercion, to psychological conflict, or to   
chance? Certainly all three factors were important. The chance   
lay in the opportunity he found to leave the country, an opportunity   
which, to be sure, he had done much to create. His bloodhound's   
nose for coercion made him especially sensitive to the manipulative   
aspects of thought reform. His heroic self-image contributed to the   
  
294 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
strength of his resistance. At the same time, his overwhelming psy-   
chological conflicts had produced an urgent need to escape. To put   
it another way, he left because he perceived an incompatibility be-   
tween his personal character structure and the Communist environ-   
ment around him. For him, thought reform had a reverse effect:   
before it he had been an avowed (if somewhat disgruntled) sym-   
pathizer; soon after, he became a bitterly disenchanted opponent.   
  
As for Hu's experiences in Hong Kong, he tried to establish him-   
self there as an anti-Communist writer. From what we know about   
him, and about Hong Kong, it would have been predictable that   
he would not have had an easy time. At the age of twenty-six, he   
had not been able to establish any workable adult life pattern; he   
was still in the midst of an action-oriented search, a continuous   
identity crisis, which had begun at the age of sixteen. We would ex-   
pect him to experiment, as most refugee Chinese intellectuals did,   
with new identities and new ideologies. And we would expect his   
experiments to be consuming in their intensity, heroic in their   
proportions, and devastating in their potential for disillusionment.   
This is essentially what did happen — but it is not the whole story,   
for as tenacious as these patterns were within Hu, he was not en-   
tirely incapable of change.   
  
The first great shock he had to sustain was the news of his father's   
death — probably at the hands of a new "People's Court" — which he   
heard within a few months after his arrival. His emotions were   
similar to those he had experienced at hearing about his father's   
first imprisonment, but this time they were much more severe. He   
had the same visions of mob terrorism, similar feelings of guilt and   
responsibility, and an even greater preoccupation with his failure   
to be filial: "I regretted very much that I could not be there. . . .   
It is a strong Chinese tradition that a son should be present at the   

----------------------- Page 251-----------------------

time of his father's death. It is part of filial piety." Even before this   
news, he had begun to be discouraged about his difficulty in locating   
an anti-Communist group with whom he could work, about the un-   
concerned attitude of Hong Kong people toward Communist China,   
and about his dependency upon a friend's kindness for support.   
Discouragement gave way to depression, and for several weeks he   
had little hope.   
  
Then a few articles he had written for Hong Kong periodicals   
  
A CHINESE ODYSSEY 295   
  
caught the attention of the leaders of a newly-formed "third force"   
youth group, and he was asked to join them. Before long he was   
playing a prominent role in the group's activities, enjoying living   
and working with its members, and contributing to their sense of   
enthusiasm. The organization became more recognized and began   
to receive American subsidies; however, he noted that the co-opera-   
tive atmosphere began to give way to intrigue and a struggle for   
power. Soon he came into sharp conflict with the other leaders   
over their dismissal of some of his colleagues, and he decided that   
lie had no alternative but to resign. Disillusioned and despairing,   
he bitterly resented his adversaries; but he was not without some   
tendency to place part of the blame upon himself. "I left with the   
feeling I had personally failed. ... I was disappointed and frus-   
trated, and I had no more 'heart'." Some time later the same pat-   
tern repeated itself: active involvement with a new anti-Commu-   
nist press organization, severe personal conflicts, then resignation   
from the group. The second experience revealed Hu's panic at the   
threat of being dominated by one of the other leaders. "Although   
he never came to dominate me, I resented the fact that he had been   
planning ways to do this. ... I couldn't concentrate on anything   
else. . . . Just thinking how to stop this person's domination."   
At one point in this conflict, Hu became aware of his own excit-   
ability, and commented to his close friend (our interpreter) that   
there must be something wrong with him, and that perhaps he was   
in need of a woman. (He later told me, however, that he had never   
had sexual relations because he feared that "once I gave myself to   
it, I might lose all control" — a statement which reflected a fear of   
his own hostile urges, as well as his feelings of attraction and re-   
pulsion for any total experience.) According to the interpreter,   
others in the press group admitted that Hu's rival had attempted   
to dominate all of the members; but they felt that Hu was over-   
sensitive and impulsive, and that he still retained Communist-like   
tendencies to view every situation as a struggle for power.   
  
After each of these episodes, Hu retreated into a quiet rural life   
— long walks, swimming, and lonely meditation upon his personal   
plight, a habit he kept from early adolescence. When he was calmer   
and felt less pressured, he began to accept some of the judgments   
of others, even judgments about his own character. He realized that   
he had unwittingly favored Communist-like organization within   

----------------------- Page 252-----------------------

  
296 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
both the press groups, and determined to "lead myself away from   
this old Communist way of thinking." He also began to change his   
estimate of human character. "I had always felt that when sup-   
pressed, people could fight for their ideals and sacrifice every-   
thing. ... I came to understand that what friends had told me   
was true — that there is a lust for power in the human mind, and   
that those who failed to understand this get into all kinds of   
trouble."   
  
And like many other refugee Chinese intellectuals, he gravitated   
— because of his need and its availability — toward Christianity.   
He again came to a new ideology through a kind and parental   
mentor, this time a woman: a middle-aged American Lutheran   
missionary who had worked for many years in a province near his   
home and was able to talk to him in a dialect which reminded him   
of his childhood. In addition to these geographical and emotional   
associations, so important for Chinese, he was moved by her affec-   
tion for him. "When I went to see her I had a feeling that her con-   
cern for me was something I badly needed. You might say she had   
a kind of maternal feeling for me." He felt that she and her col-   
leagues were among the few people he had ever encountered who   
were "concerned with the welfare of human beings as such without   
hoping to get something out of them."   
  
He also found a spirit of humility and compromise among the   
members of this group; he thought this spirit was Christianity's   
contribution to Western democracy, and he wished to emulate it,   
realizing that he lacked it in his own character. "My old attitude   
was that when I thought myself in the right, I must stick strictly to   
my views and never give in or compromise. . . . This caused me   
much suffering in the past." He attributed his intransigence to Chi-   
nese tradition: "The word compromise had an undesirable flavor in   
old Chinese society." Although this view slighted his own cultural   
heritage (Confucianism actually emphasizes a spirit of com-   
promise) and perhaps was naively uncritical of Lutheran Chris-   
tianity (in which uncompromising credal purity has often been a   
prominent feature), it did have validity for Hu's own experience.   
  
Equally important was Hu's discovery that the Christian con-   
cepts of guilt and sin offered a meaningful interpretation of all of   
the evils he had seen, as well as a way to deal with his own angers:   
  
A CHINESE ODYSSEY 297   
  
When I was on the mainland, I was influenced by Confucian teaching,   
ideas that human nature was basically good, and that people can do   
good if they wish to. ... I could not reconcile this belief with the   
evils I observed in the KMT, the Communist, and the refugee organiza-   
tions in Hong Kong. ... In my own mind there was turmoil, and I   

----------------------- Page 253-----------------------

was troubled by feelings of hatred for certain people. . . . But from   
reading the Scriptures, I learned that evils exist in every human being,   
including myself, and that the only way to remove these evils is to   
forgive them.   
  
Although Hu's antagonisms scarcely disappeared, his association   
with the Lutherans did seem to agree with him. They found a place   
for him to stay near them, and offered him a job as secretary and   
translator. This happened concurrently with our interviews; and   
after living among the Lutherans for a few months Hu gained   
weight, and seemed much more relaxed and content than I had   
ever seen him. He described leading a "quiet, pleasant life," and   
said he was increasingly interested in Christian teachings.   
  
At the same time (six years after his thought reform) he dis-   
cussed with me some of his lingering preoccupations with his   
escape from Communism, and the terrifying images of the Com-   
munist cadres which remained with him. He still had nightmares,   
although not as frequently as he did earlier in his Hong Kong stay,   
in which he was fleeing Communist cadres, resisting capture, even   
shooting and killing a pursuer; sometimes he dreamt he was hunted   
as a criminal, sometimes helped by a kind friend, but never quite   
escaping. The cadre appeared as an all-powerful apparition which   
his eyes were forced to behold.   
  
. . . a big terrible monster whose face and body-build I cannot see   
clearly. He does not actually appear to be a substantial person. What I   
see is only the Communist uniform. ... It is as if there is nothing   
specifically to force me to see him, but I am compelled to see him of   
my own volition. I don't wish to but I have to. ... I am so full of   
fear I cannot consider refusing.   
  
He went on to give a subjective analysis of the sources of the   
cadre's effectiveness; using machine images, he came to conclusions   
similar to those of others who have studied the Communist cadre.   
  
A Communist cadre is an apparatus rather than an individual. His   
knowledge, ability, emotion, every part of his body, is dedicated to the   
  
298 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
utilization of this piece of apparatus. That is why he has no real emo-   
tion toward you, no real feeling. That is why he is so terrible. ... In   
action, a Communist cadre is more effective than an ordinary man be-   
cause where an ordinary man would quit a job and say that he has done   
his best, a Communist cadre would go on and finish it. He is always   
responsible for what he has done because there is a deliberate system   
behind him such that he may be considered responsible for something   
he had done ten years before. He must check and check again, as when   
he finishes a job and hands in his work, there is no way of escape. He   
is not working for himself, but for the glory of the Party. 4   
  

----------------------- Page 254-----------------------

Hu was still troubled by guilty, fearful secrets which he had   
kept from the Communists:   
  
I have a feeling of guilt — not to my own conscience — but because I had   
a secret with them as one who came from among them. . . . When I   
decided to leave the mainland, I did not tell them that I had been a   
student at North China University or that I had been in the People's   
Revolutionary Army. If I had told them this, they would not have let   
me go. . . . If they knew that I were here working against them and   
they caught me, they would show no mercy. ... It is like being a   
member of an underground gang somewhere, deciding that this is not   
decent, and then leaving. The fear that the gang would catch up with   
you would still be in your heart.   
  
He expressed a feeling of helplessness toward Communism, and   
made it clear that its control over him had been the most thorough   
and the most frightening he had ever known. When he compared   
it with previous authorities in his life, even his step-grandmother   
seemed less forbidding: "She could compel me to do things that I   
was not willing to do, but she could never make me say that they   
were good things." And so did the KMT:   
  
The KMT could bore me, make me disgusted, bitter and angry at them   
— but even when they arrested me and I thought that I was being shot,   
they could not frighten me. It was the Communists who really made   
me fearful. Now I have no way to protect myself against them. If I face   
a Communist cadre he can do anything he wants to me and I can do   
nothing to him.   
  
He began to ask me many questions about human emotions, per-   
haps the most significant of which was, "How is it possible for a   
man to hate — to be irreconcilable in this hatred — but to actually   
submit to the person or group which he hates?" He was speaking of   
  
A CHINESE ODYSSEY 299   
  
his general conflicts relating to hatred and submission, but his as-   
sociations also suggested that he was indirectly referring to a feeling   
of being still partly under the Communists' intellectual and emo-   
tional control, a control which he was always fighting off within   
himself. This interpretation was confirmed by a second question,   
asked in ostensible reference to someone else: "Why is it that some   
people who have suffered persecution and oppression at the hands of   
the Communists remain enthusiastic about them?"   
  
As he became more introspective, Hu expressed a basic insight   
about the relationship of his character to the Communist move-   
ment, and about his own quest for selfhood:   
  
I now realized why the Communists tried so hard to gain me over. . . .   
When I believe in something I can forget myself completely while   
throwing myself into the cause. It was for this reason that 1 could be so   

----------------------- Page 255-----------------------

unusually persistent in maintaining my own opinion in opposition to   
that of the Communists. For this is also a standard characteristic of   
the Communist cadre, to be so determined because he had no self, and   
the Communists knew that I could be a very good cadre. ... I was   
proud of these characteristics within myself before. But now I under-   
stand that if I could preserve some of my individual interest, some   
individuality, I would be less like the Communists. . . . My life would   
be more balanced and I would not go to such extremes as I used to.   
  
Hu was beginning to recognize his own totalism, and understand   
its affinity for Communism and its usefulness in preserving his   
identity against Communist pressures. The recognition itself sug-   
gested that he was making a dent in this totalism, as did his iden-   
tification with Western Protestant individualism. He had (at least   
temporarily) traded heroic action for introspection, leadership for   
discipleship.   
  
This may have been just another lull in Hu's lifelong emotional   
storm, but perhaps it was something more as well. I was not sur-   
prised when he told me during a follow-up visit to Hong Kong I   
made years later that he had become dissatisfied with Lutheranism   
and Lutherans (although he had been baptized), that he no longer   
felt comforted by religion, and that most of the missionaries were   
"not truly religious." He also attributed their failure to support him   
more actively for an American visa to his disinclination to pursue a   
religious career. Whatever truth there was in this last assertion, his   
critical attitudes were part of his old pattern, reflections of a still-   
  
3OO THOUGHT REFORM   
  
viable totalism forever seeking and never finding its ideal of sin-   
cerity. On the other hand, there had been no explosive break with   
the missionaries, and after an association of almost eight years Hu   
was still living and working among them. As always, he was imposing   
severe discipline upon himself, but his cause had finally become one   
of self-interest: he rose at six in the morning to study English and   
mathematics to prepare himself for the possibility of further educa-   
tion in America. And he was no longer alone; he had met a girl   
he wanted to marry and bring to America with him.   
  
I do not know what the outcome of Hu's personal struggles will   
be; I do know that in his own exaggerated way, he had lived   
through and described to me most of the major emotional dilemmas   
of his generation of Chinese intellectuals.   
  
CHAPTER   
  
THE OLDER GENERATION:   
ROBERT CHAO   
  
As much as Hu's story does reveal about the thought   
reform of intellectuals and about their background   

----------------------- Page 256-----------------------

environments, it cannot tell us everything. Others differed from   
him in their identity patterns and their responses to reform. Some   
of these differences — as we shall observe in the three case histories   
which follow — were a matter of personal variation, and others of   
group trends.   
  
The age at which one undergoes reform has great significance: a   
revolutionary university reform experience at forty-five cannot be   
the same as one at twenty-five. The next life story, that of an older   
intellectual, has an emotional flavor quite distinct from Hu's.   
  
Robert Chao had been a Nationalist official for almost twenty   
years when he was "invited" (in effect, ordered) to attend a   
revolutionary university set up soon after the takeover especially   
for affiliates of the old regime. When I met him in Hong Kong   
three years later (we had been introduced by a common acquaint-   
ance), he was working as a translator for a Western business con-   
cern. A stocky and ruddy-faced man who had studied for several   
years in America, he was unusually articulate and his English was   
fluent.   
  
I soon gained the impression, however, that he had mixed feel-   
  
301   
  
302 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
ings about talking with me. He was overly courteous (too proper   
even for a Chinese), and he rarely looked at me directly. I sensed   
in his guarded manner a fear that should he permit himself to relax,   
his exaggerated self-control might give way and permit disturbing   
feelings to emerge. And this is what frequently happened during   
the course of our interviews: after cautious platitudes and detached   
statements of general principles, where he felt on safe ground,   
something would set off in him a brief, tense outburst in which   
the frustration and pain of his emotional life would be revealed.   
Our sessions did not become any easier for him as the work   
progressed, and for this reason we spent just nine hours together —   
enough time only to discuss the main currents of his experiences.   
  
Brought up in a rural area of Hunan Province during the early   
years of the twentieth century, Mr. Chao's first memory was of   
weird supernatural fear, from which he still does not feel free:   
  
It was New Years Day. ... I was about four years old. . . .1 was   
brought out by a maternal uncle to the Temple of the City God. And   
in front of the Temple, under a wooden shed, there were two statues   
made of clay. There was an image of a man attending a horse. . . .   
Somehow I got scared — very scared — and very ill, because he looked at   
me as though smiling at me. ... I was very sick after this for a few   
weeks. It was a serious illness and nothing would cure me — no medicine   
would help me until my relatives suggested that they get a Taoist priest   

----------------------- Page 257-----------------------

to say incantations. And actually this had the effect of curing me. . . .   
I was generally superstitious — and later read a lot of superstitious books.   
It was a different world from now. . . . These things can be scarey. I   
can still be scared by them. . . . Superstition influences me even now.   
  
The only child in a family of small landowners, he was still in his   
infancy when his father died. He later heard tales of his father's   
adventurous career as a local civil servant during the Ch'ing dynasty,   
adventurous because of the presence of bandits and the frequent   
social and natural upheavals. He and his mother lived with different   
groups of relatives, but it was she — a little-educated, yet strong-   
minded and intelligent country woman — who took on the roles of   
both parents, and devoted her major life energies to the boy's future.   
Chao spoke of his mother and of her sacrifices for him in glowing   
terms:   
  
She was a very affectionate woman. As a young widow, I was her only   
child and this made her treasure me. . . . The only son is very spoiled   
  
THE OLDER GENERATION 303   
  
in China. . . . She was kindhearted and generous — very open-minded   
and modern for her age. She was progressive and believed in change.   
. . . She was very clever and knew the importance of education. . . .   
She made great personal sacrifices to get me a complete education . . .   
which was not ordinarily available to a person of my background.   
  
Mother and son combined forces to overcome financial and social   
difficulties and obtain this education, which included a special tutor   
in Chinese classics, the best primary and secondary school training   
available in the region, and later a university degree and graduate   
study abroad.   
  
As a youngster, Chao spent most of his time at home with his   
mother, had few friends, and focused his attention mainly on his   
studies. He was extremely competitive, frequently transferring from   
one school to another when his superior grades made this possible.   
His mother moved with him, first to a large provincial city for his   
secondary school training, and then to Peking for his university   
education; she sold the small amount of remaining family land   
to get money for them to live upon.   
  
Together they planned out Chao's future, always calculating   
carefully how best to use their resources, how best to carry out the   
steps necessary to attain worldly success. During the early years   
she contributed what she could from her own knowledge, teaching   
him to read and write, and telling him the historical anecdotes,   
legends, and romances which were part of her heritage. When he   
began to attend boarding schools, and to move beyond her intel-   
lectual capability, she lived apart from him and saw him on week-   
ends. Their efforts were rewarded: Chao obtained a government   
scholarship which included his undergraduate university work in   

----------------------- Page 258-----------------------

China as well as advanced studies in the United States financed   
by Boxer indemnity funds.   
  
From the time of his arrival in America, Chao (now Robert)   
began for the first time to encounter difficulties, both external and   
internal. He was extremely uncomfortable about his social status,   
highly sensitive to slights of any kind and especially to possible sug-   
gestions of racial discrimination. During our talks, it was still dif-   
ficult for him to come to terms with his own feelings about these   
problems:   
  
I think the Americans have a justification because I can see clearly the   
racial situation in America. . . . They have such a large Negro popu-   
  
304 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
lation, so many alien people from Eastern Europe. . . . And besides, I   
was very proud myself — I didn't want to mix with them either. ... I   
didn't go with any coeds — and in a way it was disconcerting — but I   
never had the courage. Once I felt the Americans looked down on the   
Chinese, I was too proud to make approaches.   
  
He found, as did many Chinese in the West, that his friends were   
limited to other Chinese students, or to members of minority   
groups: "I had American friends, but I discovered that most of them   
were Jews. It was commiseration." Only after we had discussed   
these matters at some length did he begin to express his hostilities,   
and even then he checked himself in the midst of his brief out-   
burst:   
  
I think the Americans have a superiority complex. In a way they are   
narrow-minded, not interested in knowing foreign things and foreign   
people. ... Of course as a human being I could not be free from   
resentment. . . . But then I was never insulted during my experience   
in America. I felt that the Americans showed indifference rather than   
discrimination. Those people who showed too much interest in the   
Chinese were too patronizing and not spontaneous.   
  
He also experienced a certain amount of indecision about his   
course of study, switching from journalism to history, starting at   
one large midwestern university where he found that "life was too   
lonely," and then changing to another. In the end, he used only   
four of the five years allotted by his scholarship for study in Amer-   
ica. He brought back to China a Chinese-American bride, as well   
as considerable admiration for American confidence and self-re-   
liance: "I noticed that Americans, in making their own efforts, are   
sure of their destiny."   
  
He described his experiences in his own country during the next   
twenty years as "a sad story — a story of frustrations." Working for   
various government departments as administrator, publicist, and   
diplomat, occasionally engaging in brief periods of teaching — many   

----------------------- Page 259-----------------------

of these jobs being held during the confusion of wartime — he was   
perpetually disappointed, and in his view, unappreciated.   
  
Sometimes he blamed himself:   
  
The trouble is I haven't stuck to any line. If I had stayed in the foreign   
service, I could have risen and become an ambassador. ... I had   
friends high up, but I didn't follow one particular man or faction. I was   
often offered jobs which I thought were below me.   
  
THE OLDER GENERATION 305   
  
Sometimes he blamed the ingratitude of friends and political   
associates:   
  
I knew everybody in Chinese government — from the generals down   
many were my close friends. But although I had helped them plenty,   
they have never given me help. . . . Frequently in a foreign office,   
people didn't want you under them because your qualifications were   
better than theirs.   
  
But he was always highly critical of the entire government struc-   
ture of which he was a part. "There was absolutely no security if   
you didn't accumulate money. . . . Everyone was out for himself."   
  
Therefore, at the time of the change in regimes, he felt neither   
sympathy for the victorious Communists nor loyalty to the defeated   
Nationalists:   
  
I knew nothing about Chinese Communism, but from contacts with the   
Russians during the war, I did not like Russian Communism, as I   
thought there was no freedom. But on the other hand, I did not feel   
that I had an obligation to flee with the Nationalists. They were going   
nowhere, and we did not think that they could hold Taiwan.   
  
When he was sent for his thought reform, he was "tense" about   
not knowing what to expect, but at the same time he anticipated   
from the experience an opportunity to "fit in better" with the   
Communists. From the beginning, he tried to remain emotionally   
detached, to adopt a practical wait-and-see attitude, and to judge   
the program on the basis of the material rewards it might offer him.   
His cautious and pliable approach — also that of many fellow "stu-   
dents" much like him — was a far cry from the youthful enthusiasms   
of Hu's group:   
  
I entered into the situation without knowing exactly what it would be. I   
wanted to see results. . . . We felt that if it suited our interests, then   
it would be successful. If I were to get the kind of job that I wanted, it   
would be successful. If I did not get a desirable job, it would have the   
opposite kind of result. ... At the beginning, we discussed the best   
way to go about it, which we decided was . . . not to be too progressive   
and not to be reactionary. . . . There was nothing idealistic, we had   

----------------------- Page 260-----------------------

no emotional abandon. . . . But most of us wanted to get on the good   
side of the Communists. . . . Often the sessions were sterile because   
everybody followed the Party line.   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
But when the reformers began to demand that the participants   
deepen their self-analyses, Chao found that it became increasingly   
difficult, even for such a wary group, to maintain its detachment:   
  
We were always baffled because we did not know how to link theory with   
practice. ... To link up personal experience with the question being   
discussed. . . . They were always asking us for examples. This was diffi-   
cult.   
  
And as the participants revealed more of themselves, they found   
that detachment gave way to genuine involvement:   
  
Everybody began to know a great deal about everybody else. . . . Every-   
thing was public — money, crime, past sins, and so on. We developed a   
kind of esprit de corps.   
  
Nor could Chao and his fellow students avoid the usual group   
hostilities, especially when individual people overplayed their "pro-   
gressive" roles:   
  
Although we wanted to increase our solidarity, in practice often the op-   
posite occurred. Men didn't like to be criticized, and they would regard   
those who criticized them as an enemy — as in bourgeois psychology.   
This caused bad feelings in the group. . . . Sometimes a man was not   
sincere and would try to put something over. . . . Being not really pro-   
gressive he would falsify his thought and pretend to be more progressive   
than the others. Everyone was acting to a certain extent, but there was   
no need in trying to be extra progressive. . . . Such a man would be   
ostracized by the group. . . . Even the Communists don't want this.   
  
In dealing with the problem of guilt, the men continued their   
efforts to go through the proper motions:   
  
It was taken for granted that every man from the old society was a bad   
man — guilty of all kinds of crimes — that anyone connected with the   
Nationalist regime was really unpatriotic. ... In discussing this, every-   
body tried to put himself in a favorable light. Even when someone ad-   
mitted guilt, it was with the intention of showing everyone how much   
he had improved.   
  
Again Chao and the others found themselves unable to remain   
detached, for their past experiences made them especially suscepti-   
ble to a genuine sense of guilt — which offered an avenue of entry   
for thought reform influences:   
  
THE OLDER GENERATION 307   

----------------------- Page 261-----------------------

  
I knew that in the past I had done things without purpose — whereas the   
Communists said everything should be done with the idea of serving the   
people. . . . The important question was whether you considered what   
you did in the past really wrong. ... I admitted that certain criticisms   
of me were valid — having a self-seeking approach and not considering   
the masses. . . . And when you put things down on paper, you believe   
them more than when you just say them. . . . You really feel them to   
be shortcomings. . . . We all fell for the phrase, "working for the peo-   
ple." We couldn't answer it.   
  
This acceptance extended to much of the Communist message:   
"You begin to believe a great deal of it . . . and all of us believed   
that the Communists were better than the Nationalists."   
  
But when Chao summed up the effects of thought reform for me,   
he presented two alternative, almost contradictory views. The first   
was a strongly negative statement, based upon a return to a de-   
tached and calculating judgment: the Communists had not come   
through with a good job offer and therefore the "reform" did not   
succeed:   
  
After thought reform, they offered us low clerical jobs in the farming   
areas. . . . The indoctrination failed because we did not like the jobs   
assigned. We became more reactionary. . . . Now I am more critical of   
them. They allow no personal freedom, and no freedom of silence. . . .   
They are liars and I do not believe them.   
  
The second view was one of moderate praise, and a recognition   
of personal gain from thought reform.   
  
Any Communist indoctrination, well taken, must leave some effects. It   
is not entirely bad. ... A man who has been indoctrinated will always   
think differently as compared with those who have not been indoc-   
trinated — at least in certain respects. For instance, I might have been   
very haughty to my servants before, but now I would never treat servants   
as some of the Hong Kong people treat their servants. I think that this   
emphasis on labor and the respect they pay to labor is a very good idea.   
. . . Personally I had a great change. Before I had all of the ambitions   
that other people had. ... I was egocentric. . . . But now I really   
realize that the individual is rather insignificant.   
  
He tried to resolve his dilemma by transcending both views and   
withdrawing from all involvements:   
  
People don't understand me. When they pick a quarrel with me, I don't   
respond — even if you persecute me. It is because of what I have been   
through. I am above human emotions.   
  
308 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
Yet the circumstances of Mr. Chao's departure from Communist   

----------------------- Page 262-----------------------

China reveal he was susceptible to human emotions after all: he   
ran off with a Western woman who was leaving for Hong Kong.   
The affair dissolved after their arrival, and just at that time, travel   
between China and Hong Kong became much more difficult. He   
felt that if he returned to China, as he had more or less planned to   
do when he left (his wife, mother, and children were still there),   
he would not again have the chance to leave, and would also be re-   
garded with suspicion. His eventual decision to stay had little to do   
with ideological considerations:   
  
I left only because of this woman. If I felt that I could move in and out   
freely I would have gone back. I wasn't too decided. ... I could have   
been very useful to them [the Communists]— one of their propagandists   
in the foreign office or something.   
  
In his contemplative moments, Chao took a somewhat Taoist or   
Buddhist view of his life, emphasizing its pointlessness and its   
nothingness. He expressed this view in one of his responses to the   
Thematic Apperception Test, when he was shown a blank card and   
asked to make up a story: 1   
  
On this piece of cardboard all I can see just now is empty whiteness.   
But if I look at it more intently I can imagine things which crowd   
into a life of many years. These things were the happenings in a man's   
career. When one came into this world he was just like a piece of white   
cardboard. There was no image, nothing engraved on it. Pretty soon   
when he got into contact with worldly things he carried out his own   
destiny and he could have painted many pictures of many kinds — some   
gay and some sad, some successful, some failures, some permanent, some   
ephemeral. And this seems to be what happened to me. In my life I   
have gone through all of the stages, but in a moment of self-complacency,   
it would seem to me that everything vanishes again into this original   
piece of cardboard, without picture, without color, and without emotions.   
  
This passive resignation — real as it was for Chao — did not pre-   
vent him from calling into play the more active side of his char-   
acter. He showed extraordinary energy and effectiveness in finding   
work in Hong Kong, arranging for his wife and his children to leave   
Communist China, and then utilizing his Western contacts to set   
up employment for himself and residence for his family in England.   
There he will probably carry on ably, if without clear purpose.   
  
THE OLDER GENERATION 309   
  
Chao's life story (even more than Hu's) indicates something of   
the vast emotional journey which many of his generation were re-   
quired to make from the "old China" of their youth to the Com-   
munist reform of their middle years. Taking into account the per-   
sonal, cultural, and political obstacles they faced, their accomplish-   
ments were often impressive; but each of these accomplishments   
was apt to be paid for with an increasing sense of anomie — with pro-   
found personal and social dislocation and unrelatedness.   

----------------------- Page 263-----------------------

  
Chao's oldest identities (oldest in the history of both his culture   
and his own life) were those of the fearful rural mystic and the   
"mother-directed" filial son. The first identity, which included both   
an awe of the supernatural and an imaginative richness, was his   
bond with generations of people from his local area. It formed a   
basic underlying identity upon which later more worldly ones were   
grafted, and it contributed to his inability to ever feel truly at home   
in the modern, urban world. Many Chinese intellectuals (including   
Hu) possessed similar elements of rural mysticism, however sup-   
pressed by the rational demands of both Confucian and Western   
teachings; but Chao reveals the strong staying power of this rural   
self, which made it both a refuge and an embarrassment.   
  
Chao's relationship with his mother supplied him with some-   
thing of a conveyor identity, and allowed him to remain filial and   
at the same time move beyond the narrow world of filialism. It was   
not unusual in Chao's generation, especially if one's beginnings   
were rather humble, for a parent like this — rooted in tradition, but   
possessing the capacity to imagine a modern future — to help a child   
make this great emotional leap; nor is such a phenomenon confined   
to Chinese society. In Chao's case, more conflict was involved than   
he cared to reveal: he made clear his early dependency upon his   
mother, as well as his sense of gratitude and of personal debt; but   
from some of his test responses (descriptions of bitter disagreements   
between mothers and sons) , I learned of his struggle to become inde-   
pendent of her control, and of the guilt and resentment which   
accompanied this struggle. This mother-son alliance of love and   
ambition was nonetheless the means by which a rural child of the   
old China reached the educational channels which transformed   
him into a sophisticated (if brittle) modern Chinese man.   
  
Chao became immersed in his personal ideology of social ac-   
complishment and recognition, and remained relatively detached   
  
3IO THOUGHT REFORM   
  
from broad ideological movements. Although his developing iden-   
tity of the detached careerist was a natural outgrowth of his relation-   
ship with his mother, it was also an identity very frequently chosen   
by others during these chaotic years — a means of survival in a so-   
ciety whose moral cohesion was rapidly breaking down.   
  
For Chao's generation, the path to accomplishment was Western   
learning, and the price of Western learning some degree of West-   
ernization. But by spending his early twenties in America, and by   
becoming a Westernized Chinese, Chao experienced the beginning   
of an almost interminable identity crisis. Before he went, he was   
able — with some difficulty — to handle the continuous adaptations   
and personal changes necessary for his advance within Chinese so-   
ciety; but the more jarring conflict of feeling both attracted to and   
repelled by the Western world was almost too much for him. Like   

----------------------- Page 264-----------------------

many Asian students in the West, he felt himself simultaneously   
liberated and denigrated. In the midst of newfound possibilities   
for self-expression, he felt keenly his status as a non-Westerner, an   
Oriental. Along with the threat to his masculinity — Asian men are   
apt to look upon American women with trepidation, and Amer-   
ican women are likely to treat Asian men in a kindly, sisterly   
fashion — American society posed a more important threat to his   
general sense of autonomy: how much of his self would be con-   
sumed by this tantalizing new Western influence? Historical events   
both American and Chinese led Chao to value all that was West-   
ern; and men like Chao wavered between taking too great a plunge   
into Westernization and recoiling defensively into Chineseness.   
Facing all of these problems while for the first time navigating   
without his mother's help, Chao never fully recovered from the   
intense sense of identity diffusion initiated within him by his Amer-   
ican experience.   
  
He returned to China much better educated in useful Western   
ways, but less sure of what he was and where he was going. His   
sensitivity to, and expectation of, rebuff made him, over the years,   
a resentful bureaucrat, another identity in which personal conflicts   
blended with the social realities of a frequently unscrupulous en-   
vironment. This identity also was common among those Chinese   
intellectuals who threw in their lot with the Nationalist regime   
(the academic field was the only major alternative, and this had its   
own severe strains). What characterized the resentful bureaucrat   
  
THE OLDER GENERATION 31I   
  
was a lack of involvement in an ideal beyond himself, a nagging   
suspiciousness of others, and the kind of deep-seated self-hatred   
which is the inevitable outcome of losing a battle with one's sense   
of integrity.   
  
Chao and many of his associates, naturally enough, attempted to   
carry over their detached attitude to thought reform; older par-   
ticipants in any case tended to be rather cautious. Yet this exag-   
gerated detachment was a liability as well as a strength. It did en-   
able Chao to keep a cool eye out for his self-interest; but it also   
rendered him susceptible to strong feelings of guilt and shame in   
response to Communist-style self-analysis. He was most disturbed   
by the exposure of his detached careerism, most impressed by the   
Communist program to devote oneself "wholeheartedly" to serving   
"the people." As was also true for Dr. Vincent, this detached man   
— always refractory to ideologies — found much that was compelling   
in the ideology of Communism. The Westernized Chinese in Chao,   
although he did not verbalize this, was also vulnerable (had he not   
at times been contemptuous of things Chinese, and susceptible to   
alien and "subversive" influences?). Confronted with such nega-   
tive identity elements as his alienation from his own heritage, his   
uneasy emotional passivity, and his ever-violated integrity, Chao   
could not fail to respond to thought reform's clear purpose and   

----------------------- Page 265-----------------------

stringent morality.   
  
But in men of Chao's age, emotional patterns are not easily   
altered, and in the long run the self-interest of the careerist served   
as the criterion for his judgments. We can take Chao's word that   
everything depended upon the job offered at the end of the process;   
this job assignment had great significance for everyone, for it in-   
dicated the way in which the Communists identified a man in their   
system, as well as the new identity patterns which he would be   
permitted to develop. Chao's affair with the Western woman thus   
served two purposes: it permitted him, at a difficult psychological   
moment, to reassert his Asian manhood where it had been most re-   
buffed; and it got him out of China. Not only had his old emo-   
tional balance been threatened; he was again feeling unappreciated   
and badly treated. His departure, and especially his failure to return,   
reflected his awareness (like Hu's) that his character was not com-   
patible with the Communist environment.   
  
In the non-Communist world, Chao attempted to recover his   
  
312 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
detachment in the identity of a withdrawn Chinese sage. He com-   
bined the sophisticated ennui of one who has experienced every-   
thing with a return to early mysticism in the Taoist-Buddhist sense   
of the ephemeral nature of worldly experience (very much like   
Hu's father). His passions were not to be so easily stilled, but this   
at least was his ideal. Moreover, he had become expert in the tech-   
niques of personal survival: the extraordinary variety of cultures,   
subcultures, and stray environments which he had traversed were   
not wasted upon him; and in this adaptability, his character struc-   
ture is, after all, that of a modern man. 2   
  
Like Hu, Chao represented something of an extreme: his sensi-   
tivities about his background and the extent of his frustration and   
withdrawal may well have been exceptional. His detached approach   
to the social movements of his time was, of course, just the opposite   
of that of Hu. Yet his combination of adaptability and anomie — a   
combination so crucial to the outcome of his thought reform — is   
another character pattern of great importance for twentieth-century   
China.   
  
CHAPTER   
  
GEORGE CHEN: THE CON-   
VERSIONS OF YOUTH   
  
For those who faced thought reform not as young   
or mature adults, but as unformed teenagers, the   
process was as much a matter of education as re-education. Their   
reform took place in secondary schools and universities.   
  

----------------------- Page 266-----------------------

George Chen, our next Chinese subject, experienced thought   
reform on both of these levels: fifteen years old at the time of the   
Communist takeover, he was exposed to it first at a boarding school   
for two years, and then at a university for two additional years. He   
was twenty at the time that I met him, not yet one year out of   
Communist China.   
  
He was introduced to me by a first cousin of his who was an   
acquaintance of mine. A slim, delicate-looking lad, George had a   
quality that was both distant and intense. He was shy and serious,   
but by no means reluctant to express himself, and — as became   
quickly evident during the interviews — both sensitive and intel-   
ligent. We met fourteen times over the course of one year; our   
sessions together totalled more than forty hours. At George's re-   
quest, the cousin who brought us together, and who had done   
some work with me before, served as interpreter; but during later   
interviews, I used, with George's consent, one of my regular in-   
terpreters.   
  
3i3   
  
314 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
George was born in Canton, the son of a middle-level Nationalist   
official. He was the fourth of eight children, the third of five boys.   
Through most of his childhood, he remembers, his mother was "the   
symbol of the family." She had a more aristocratic background, and   
in times of difficulty her leadership and her money sustained them   
all. The close attachment between George and his mother had a   
crucial bearing upon his later life; but during his earliest years, he   
was attended to mainly by maids or amahs. One of these amahs   
(said to be as strict as she was devoted) took care of him from birth   
until the age of two-and-a-half; and when she left, George experi-   
enced (as he was later told) a true infantile depression: he cried in-   
cessantly, called the amah's name, refused food, and resisted the   
efforts of others — including his mother — to take care of him. When   
he got a bit older, he began to realize that his mother found it very   
hard to care for her eight children; she was often short of breast   
milk, and became flustered by minor crises. He came to think of her   
as possessing "the virtues and the frailties" of womanhood: senti-   
mental, indecisive, kind, easy-going, and generous.   
  
In the face of the Japanese invasion, the family moved to Hong   
Kong, where George lived from the ages of three to seven. During   
this period — and for most of his childhood — George remembers see-   
ing his father only infrequently, since distant assignments kept him   
away from home. George spent a good deal of his time with his two   
grandmothers, and each of these elderly women had a distinctive   
impact upon the boy. His paternal grandmother, a garrulous and   
opinionated lady, was kind to George and the other children; but   
she conveyed to them in no uncertain terms her moralistic, funda-   
mentalist Protestant beliefs: whoever did evil would be condemned   

----------------------- Page 267-----------------------

to everlasting suffering in Hell, and only the good would enter   
Heaven and enjoy eternal happiness. George later learned that she   
had her own cross to bear: her husband, much to the disgrace of the   
entire family, chose to ignore them and lived with a concubine in   
another section of Hong Kong. Quite different was the influence of   
George's "adopted grandmother," who was the wife of George's   
great-uncle. (The great-uncle was an elder son, and since he and   
his wife were childless, they had "adopted" George's father in order   
to continue the main line of the family.) This grandmother was a   
gay country woman who imparted to the children her own love of   
nature, and delighted in taking them on outdoor excursions and in   
  
THE CONVERSIONS OF YOUTH 315   
  
buying them frivolous presents.   
  
George remembers himself as a very weak and sickly youngster,   
who frequently suffered from indigestion, cough, and nervousness:   
"Whenever I would get very scared, this would cause me some ill-   
ness:" He was considered not strong enough to play with the other   
children, and was carried on the back of his amah longer than the   
others; despite the attention he received from his family members,   
he felt lonely a good deal of the time. Often kept indoors, he would   
sit on a small balcony and draw pictures of people, automobiles, and   
steamships he saw below, showing some talent in art and callig-   
raphy. He lived a great deal in the world of his daydreams, im-   
agining himself to be, instead of a weak little boy, a powerful hero,   
an armed policeman, a soldier, or a man of wealth who would   
deliver the family from its constant economic difficulties.   
  
Even this small child was made to feel that everything was tem-   
porary, that he and the other family members were refugees in a   
very disturbed world, and that all of them had to somehow survive   
the indignity of living and dressing in a manner considered beneath   
the family station. And it was further suggested to him that if the   
family could only return to its home in Canton, everything would   
be all right: George's father would be able to join them, their finan-   
cial status would be better, the errant grandfather would come back   
and "end the family shame," and the family would be able to hold   
up its head once more.   
  
Attending school from the ages of five to seven in Hong Kong,   
George was whisked to and from the building by his amah, and   
mixed little with the other children. Then the family moved to   
Chungking in central China and became part of a friendly wartime   
community. During the years he lived in Chungking, George's   
physical strength greatly improved, and he began to take part in all   
activities centering around the nearby school. He emerged as an out-   
standing student. He became interested in Chinese history, par-   
ticularly in great heroes of the past, and developed the ambition of   
becoming himself a national hero.   
  

----------------------- Page 268-----------------------

In 1945, when George was ten years old, the war ended. The   
family made several quick moves, finally returning to Canton. In   
rapid succession, George was sent to three different boarding   
schools, two of them run by Protestant missionary groups. These   
were his first separations from his family; and during one period of   
  
316 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
three months, his mother was several hundred miles away from   
him. The homesickness which he experienced was largely a longing   
for her; he also contrasted his sense of "coldness" at being thrust   
among strange boys in shabby dormitories with the warmth and   
recognition he had known in Chungking.   
  
When the family was finally reunited, however, he was faced   
with still another set of painful emotions, centering around an in-   
creasingly critical attitude toward his father. This protector, whose   
return he had so longed for, began to assume much less heroic pro-   
portions at close hand. Not only did George feel that he had been   
replaced in his father's affections by the younger children; he also   
began to realize that his father was not too good a family provider.   
Worse than this, he came to see his father as "not a reasonable   
man" — and to regard his outbursts of temper and general clumsi-   
ness in human relationships as extremely offensive.   
  
In his distress, George turned to the religion offered to him in   
school. Influenced by his grandmother's earlier teachings and by the   
example of his older brother, who had become a Christian, George   
was baptized at the age of twelve, together with a younger brother   
and cousin. Behind this act, in addition to family influences, was a   
highly personal quest:   
  
I then felt that life was very fleeting, and that nothing was very sure   
. . . that when one died, all of his hopes and achievements would perish   
with him . . . and that religion might be a way to a solution for all of   
this.   
  
Before long George lost interest in organized religion; but he   
never lost his concern about man's spiritual needs and the convic-   
tion that "life is much more than just its materialistic interpreta-   
tion."   
  
Whatever emotional help this religious orientation may have   
supplied him, George did succeed in righting himself, overcoming   
his youthful despair, and again distinguishing himself academically   
— this time especially in mathematics and physics. Still preferring   
literature to athletics, he continued to go his own way: "I was   
considered by others to be lonesome, although at the time I did   
not consider myself to be very lonely."   
  
Soon, however, he began to be troubled by sexual urges. He en-   
joyed the pornographic literature passed around in school as much    

----------------------- Page 269-----------------------

as the next fellow, but he suffered more than most over his enjoy-   
  
THE CONVERSIONS OF YOUTH 317   
  
ment. He dealt with the situation by establishing a personal taboo:   
"I felt very ashamed of myself. ... I would prevent myself from   
touching these books even if they were available." He found great   
relief by reading (at the age of fifteen) a Chinese translation of   
Lady Chatterley's Lover, after which "I no longer felt that sex was   
evil." But this partial enlightenment by no means eradicated his   
moralistic condemnation of his self-stimulation nor prevented a   
developing tendency (as frequent in Chinese culture as in the   
West) to distinguish sharply between the "nice girls" he knew and   
the more lascivious objects of his fantasy. "I would imagine the   
sexual act with some sexy woman, never my wife or fiancee. . . .   
I never connect physical desire with emotional interest."   
  
He was in the midst of these adolescent conflicts at the time of   
the national political excitement preceding the Communist take-   
over. Although he had shared in the wartime patriotism and anti-   
Japanese sentiment, he was slower than most youths around him to   
develop sharp political convictions. When he was fourteen, he had   
criticized his older brother because of the latter's increasing in-   
volvement with left-wing causes, believing that "young people   
should not get into these affairs because they cannot do anything   
about them." As he began to learn more himself, however, he too   
began to take a stand against the corruption of the Nationalist   
regime and in favor of far-reaching changes for his country, looking   
toward a "great leader" to bring them about. He had mixed feelings   
about the Communists: as a political party antagonistic to the   
Nationalists, he felt that they might be able to implement some of   
the necessary changes; but he could not help suspecting that they   
were "puppets of Soviet Russia."   
  
At this time, his father's activities caused him much resentment.   
With Communist hegemony imminent, his father — now at home,   
with little to do — spent hours eating and talking at tea houses,   
where, according to George, friends would come and flatter him   
and amateur palm readers would tell him of the brilliant career ahead   
of him. George bitterly condemned his father's self-indulgence, his   
eating too much, and his wasting of time and money. But he was   
even more angered by the futile, last-ditch anti-Communist activi-   
ties in which his father suddenly became involved, considering   
them nothing more than an escape from idleness, and potentially   
harmful to others in the family.   
  
When the Communist armies entered Canton, however, George   
  
318 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
realized that he too felt hostile toward them because, although   
aware of the old regime's shortcomings, "I had always taken the

Nationalist government as my mother country." Shortly afterward,   
when he returned home from school on a visit, he learned that his   
father had fled to Hong Kong. His mother had been required to   
quarter Communist soldiers in the family home, and although they   
were well-behaved, she expressed to George her resentment of the   
intrusion. She also told her son that the new regime was likely to be   
no better than the Nationalists, and quoted the Chinese proverb,   
"Crows everywhere are black."   
  
At his Protestant middle school, he found that students around   
him varied in their sentiments. Many were enthusiastic about the   
Communists, and followed the lead of political activists who —   
even in this age group— identified themselves as former members   
of the Communist underground. A significant number of students,   
however (some but not all of whom were Christian), shared   
George's suspicion of the Communists. But few had much sympathy   
for the defeated Nationalists, and George "felt foolish" about his   
own emotional loyalties to them.   
  
Thought reform (or "political study") was soon initiated, but   
only gradually. Students were told that at the middle school level   
they were more "ignorant" than "contaminated." Regular political   
classes were started, as well as small group sessions for criticism and   
self-criticism; the latter at first took up about two hours a day and   
were not regularly held. Political instructors were chosen from   
among the most "progressive" of the old teachers. One of these   
presented the Communist doctrine in earnest, logical terms and had   
a profound effect upon George:   
  
I was always moved listening to him. ... It was under his influence   
that my thought began to change a few months after the liberation.   
Emotionally, I was still in favor of the Nationalist Government. All my   
family and relatives didn't like this new regime, and I myself also felt   
that the new regime was hostile to us. But rationally I could not oppose   
it. I thought its way of expression a little too exaggerated, but its princi-   
ples always right; moreover, morally I should support it, because it   
represented the people, and it was righteous and justified.   
  
Beyond considerations of logic, George was deeply affected by   
such emotions as the urge to belong and the need for hope — to the   
point of experiencing something close to a religious conversion:   
  
THE CONVERSIONS OF YOUTH 319   
  
How this occurred is a little vague. One night I went back to school   
alone. On the road to the dormitory in the campus there were only a   
few dimly-lit road lamps, and the place seemed very lonesome. I sud-   
denly felt very lonely, and had the understanding of what my own situa-   
tion was. I knew that I had no future, that people like us seemed to   
have been thrown out. And yet I could not even hate this regime. Then   
suddenly my thought turned towards the opposite direction. Perhaps   
this revolution was good for everybody. Perhaps all of us would one day   

----------------------- Page 271-----------------------

be happy and satisfied just as the Communists had said. If so, why   
should I feel sorry any more? ... I once thought that my change in   
emotion was made by the power of will after my intellectual understand-   
ing had changed. But I can see it in retrospect now, that whenever I was   
bothered emotionally by the thought of having no future and being   
thrown out politically, I always tried to think toward the opposite di-   
rection, and then would feel rather resolved in the new point of view.   
  
Over the next two years, the Communist material presented in   
lectures, discussions, and reading assignments always appealed to   
the students' "conscience and compassion" so that "we could not   
neglect nor turn away from it." Even when the program seemed   
moderate, George felt that it was "very tense inside." He occasion-   
ally experienced doubts, and he once expressed to a cousin the be-   
lief that the regime was undemocratic and illiberal. But his cousin   
disagreed with him, replying, "If you are right about this, what   
future can we have for our country?" George's doubts were also sup-   
pressed by his need to believe: "I thought to myself, 'If the Com-   
munists were really malicious and wicked, what would we do?'   
This problem was too formidable. Everybody preferred the thought   
that they were righteous and just . . . and everybody was willing   
to believe this."   
  
Three mass campaigns — "Accuse Japan," "Accuse America," and   
"Enlist for the Army" — dramatically mobilized student emotions.   
The first of these campaigns, according to George, was especially   
effective because the students, young as they were, could recall   
personal antagonisms toward the Japanese:   
  
Before the Accuse-Japan Meeting was launched, there was an Anti-   
Japanese-Rearmament Week, and all of the songs we sang during the   
war against Japanese aggression were played over the radio. This helped   
the students to remember wartime and to revive the old hatred. Then   
the Accuse-Japan general meeting took place for three continuous days.   
At first there were reports of the historical events of Japanese aggression   
in China, and the hideous plot of the American imperialists to rearm   
  
320 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
Japan. Then the students spoke freely about their own experiences,   
sufferings, and tragedies during the war. The first few speeches were pre-   
arranged by the Students' League and the New Democratic Youth Corps.   
. . . The atmosphere was easily achieved. . . . Many students went up   
to the stage voluntarily, and even those who did not go up had just the   
same hatred for the Japanese and for the American imperialists.   
  
George was deeply affected by this campaign, and critical of him-   
self for not being even more zealous: "I felt ashamed that I was   
less full of hate than the others."   
  
Similar passions were aroused during the "Accuse America" meet-   
ings, although George thought these less successful because students   

----------------------- Page 272-----------------------

had less personal animosity toward America. But they did resolve   
to destroy all of the imported American bluejeans which they   
owned. In retrospect, George felt this to be "the epidemic spread   
of a fashion. . . . The fear of being considered lagging behind,   
and not the genuine change of an idea."   
  
The Enlist for the Army campaign, which lasted for one month,   
was more a means of eliciting the students' willingness to serve   
than an actual attempt to obtain military personnel. George de-   
scribed the movement's moral force, and the threat of ostracism   
to those who resisted:   
  
Progressive students were always there to criticize those who were not   
willing to enlist, saying that they were just being selfish, since the fear   
of sacrifice or the consideration of one's own future were only selfishness.   
. . . The students who enlisted had some special activities together, and   
everybody wished to participate in these. . . . Those who enlisted called   
for the others to join them. . . . And those who did not enlist were   
not as well regarded. . . . To a student who did not enlist, this month   
was really a kind of persecution. . . . The constant meetings in large   
and small groups were a way of reproach. . . . You felt yourself all   
wrong. You found no way out of this. You felt that you could not stand   
among the enlisted when you met them. . . . The student who had not   
enlisted had already admitted inside his own mind that he was not right.   
. . . He felt lonely, and he and others like him did not dare to unite   
or to encourage each other. Everyone was aware that this disturbance   
could be resolved by enlisting for the army. ... I was among the en-   
listed.   
  
George felt, however (again in retrospect), that there was a   
tendency in him to resist, and that "if I had a family member to   
talk to me personally or a girl friend to oppose it," he might not   
  
THE CONVERSIONS OF YOUTH 32 1   
  
have enlisted. But his faith in Communism, like that of his fellow   
students, steadily increased.   
  
This faith was then greatly undermined during a visit to his   
family in Hong Kong over the summer vacation. And this same   
sequence occurred the following year: reinforcement of his Com-   
munist beliefs at school on the mainland, then the emergence of   
critical views in Hong Kong. He attributed these shifts to the in-   
fluence of individual family members, as well as to an underlying   
sympathy for Western democracies. "When I was on the mainland   
I had to suppress this original affection and favor. . . . But once   
arriving in Hong Kong, the suppression was relieved and my ideas   
naturally went back to their original form." In any case, the shifts   
were rather extreme: "On the mainland I thought the Communist   
aims to be just, and that I should devote myself to them. ... In   
Hong Kong, I thought the Communist aims were but lies, their   
means too cruel, and that even if we did want to achieve a modern   

----------------------- Page 273-----------------------

cosmopolitan country we should not follow the Communist way."   
Whatever his vantage point, he was extremely impressionable: "I   
was quite inevitably sentimental: on the mainland I was willing to   
believe the Communists, and in Hong Kong I was willing to oppose   
them."   
  
He was nonetheless determined to return to the mainland for   
his university education, having passed his entrance examination   
for Peking University (China's leading academic center) before his   
second Hong Kong visit. His parents bitterly opposed this and urged   
him to remain with them. His father went so far as to issue what is   
in any culture the ultimate parental threat: "If you insist upon   
going to Peking, I cannot any longer consider you my son." But   
George was less affected by this pronouncement than he was by   
his mother's obvious grief at the time of his departure. His conflict   
was so great that just after he got on the boat to go back to China,   
he had a strong urge to run ashore; and even after he arrived at   
Canton, the first mainland city on the way to Peking, he almost   
changed his mind again, and was dissuaded from returning to Hong   
Kong only by friends who urged him to remain for the sake of his   
education and his future.   
  
At the University of Peking, George found the pattern of thought   
reform similar to that at middle school, but more intensive: not   
only did criticism and self-criticism within small groups become   
  
322 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
more focused and personal, but students were expected to be in-   
stigators as well as followers. During the Three Anti Movement   
— against waste, corruption, and bureaucracy — the first of a series   
of campaigns on the campus, it was the students who searched   
out these evils among all university employees, including faculty   
members. In fact, a student, as local Communist Party secretary, ran   
the campaign, and for some time virtually ran the university.   
  
The movement followed the usual sequence: an announcement   
by Mao Tse-tung, editorials in leading newspapers about its pur-   
poses and general methods, and then preparation at the university   
itself. Posters were prominent everywhere, slogans and cartoon   
caricatures appeared on all the classroom blackboards (called the   
"blackboard press"), and loudspeakers broadcasted throughout the   
university — in dining rooms, dormitories, assembly halls, and depart-   
ment buildings. The campaign achieved its greatest intensity during   
a two-month period devoted entirely to its activities: students were   
required to remain at the university for what would ordinarily have   
been a one-month vacation period, and the beginning of the next   
term's classes was delayed for still another month. George served as   
a "detention guard," watching over those nonprofessional employees   
(servants and clerical help) who were detained in special bed-   
rooms or classrooms, each isolated and subjected to a barrage of   
pressures to confess his past participation in corrupt activities. None   

----------------------- Page 274-----------------------

of those singled out failed to confess, and some were sent to prison.   
  
For George and the other students, the most impressive events   
were the public confessions of their professors (here the Three Anti   
Movement merged with the Thought Reform Campaign). Each   
faculty member was required to make a "self-examination" before   
the students of his own department, and criticize his political short-   
comings and also his deficiencies in teaching method and outlook.   
George was impressed by the influence which students could bring   
to bear upon their professors, especially so in the case of his own   
department head:   
  
Professor M was the ex-chairman of the Chinese National League of   
Physicists, a very renowned professor. But the students did not like him   
too much. He muttered when he spoke, and he was not too sociable a   
person. . . . All the students were free to give their true opinions about   
his teaching, their criticism about him. They emphasized with him and   
with most of the professors that they neglected their teaching and were   
  
THE CONVERSIONS OF YOUTH 323   
  
more interested in research. . . . But his case was especially big because   
as faculty chairman he was accused about other aspects of university   
behavior. ... He got up and accused himself of his previous dealings   
with the KMT, his friendship with KMT leaders. He also confessed   
that he had not been very enthusiastic in thought reform, and had not   
taken a very active part in the political classes among the professors.   
Then he said that when he had been chairman of the faculty committee,   
he had not really worked as a true chairman — that he had been only   
eager to write articles in order to get them published in magazines for   
his own international fame — and that his work was really for himself,   
not for his students. . . . The students kept adding criticisms, and he   
had to criticize himself on four occasions before he was allowed to finish.   
. . . Practically speaking, almost all of the professors "bowed their   
heads" in front of the Party. They were approved sooner or later. Some   
were very tough and stubborn at first, but then to everybody's surprise,   
they would turn about face and admit that they had been wrong.   
  
George felt that some of these criticisms and self-criticisms were   
overdone, but thought most of them "reasonable"; for by now he   
was once more joining with group enthusiasms, and was in general   
accord with student actions.   
  
During the Honesty and Frankness Movement which followed   
(also a part of the Thought Reform Campaign), students turned   
their criticisms upon themselves. They were told that in the past   
the government had been corrupt and the political system "irra-   
tional," so that people were forced to be dishonest; but now, with   
an enlightened and "rational" government, one could be "honest   
and frank" about everything. In addition to the usual details about   
their backgrounds, students were expected to confess such things   
as "intrigues and wrongs of parents," cheating during examinations,   

----------------------- Page 275-----------------------

listening to illegal radio broadcasts, and (especially for women)   
lies about age.   
  
At first, George thought that any denunciation of his family   
would be immoral: "Prior to these meetings, I did not believe that   
family affiliation could be a mistake." But group pressures soon   
led him to the opposite conviction, that it would be immoral not   
to denounce one's family: "The Organization [Party, Youth Corps,   
and government] kept emphasizing that attachment toward our   
families was selfish and wrong, since they had been against the wel-   
fare of the people. So I began to feel that by loving my family, I   
was neglecting my duty to my country." Like Hu, George felt   
guilty over keeping a secret: "I also thought that if each individual   
  
324 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
kept something secret, something only known to himself, it would   
certainly have a bad effect upon his work for the government —   
and for the sake of the people, it was right to ask everyone to tell   
the truth." And he was greatly influenced by the unanimous con-   
fession trend among the forty freshmen physics students in his   
section: "When I saw others criticizing their family happily, and I   
contrasted this with my own reluctance, I began to think that this   
must be due to my own selfishness." By this time, his inner moral   
conflict had become inextricably merged with fear of external re-   
prisal, so that the only solution he saw was to submit.   
  
I felt very confused and upset. ... I knew that the matter must be   
settled — and that if I didn't do it well, the government would discover   
that I wasn't being frank enough and I would be in for trouble. I felt   
that if I could once and for all settle the turmoil in my mind, I would   
calm down and be able to feel that I had done my duty to my country.   
  
In deciding what to confess, George was influenced by others be-   
fore him ("they set good examples for me") and by his realization   
that the purpose of the movement was to get people to confess   
those things they most wished to conceal:   
  
To me the only thing I wanted to conceal was that I had come from a   
reactionary, bureaucratic family — so this was the thing to confess. . . .   
I told that my father had been a KMT official, a KMT party member,   
and had held important KMT positions. I said that he had been a   
reactionary, a man who worked for the welfare of his class which was   
against the welfare of the people. . . . and that my attachment for my   
family was selfish and wrong. . . .   
  
He experienced the relief of one who has carried out his obliga-   
tions: "I had the feeling that what I did was right, because it was   
what the government required me to do, and that it was proper   
behavior." But his family attachments could not be severed, and   
he could not avoid recurrent guilt:   
  

----------------------- Page 276-----------------------

When I would receive letters from my family, or look through my lug-   
gage and see reminders of home, I felt sorry about what I had done. . . .   
Other students told me that after they had made their confession they   
considered their relationship with their family ended, and that they felt   
great relief and did not have to worry any more. ... I did not feel this   
way.   
  
THE CONVERSIONS OF YOUTH 325   
  
George also experienced the full impact of one other campaign   
— the fabricated Chinese charges about bacteriological warfare.   
  
At a mass meeting there were formal reports given of the proofs available   
— of American planes having carried leaves with insects and bacteria,   
pictures of these. . . . Then all of the students went to an open exhibi-   
tion in Peking of small glass bottles of leaves that carried the germs, as   
well as insects — also test tubes, and dissected pathological parts of dead   
people who had died from these germs — everything in great detail . . .   
cholera and other epidemic diseases to destroy the agriculture of China.   
It said that some of these germs had been dropped in North Korea,   
some in Manchuria, and some in other Chinese provinces. ... At first   
I was not so sure. . . . But later, when the confessions of American   
pilots were published 1 — photographs and attached signatures — and   
there was confirmation of the fact by several famous scientists from   
various countries, including a Fellow of the Royal Society, I believed it   
to be true.   
  
Although convinced by this campaign, George found himself   
once more deficient in hatred, this time because he was unable to   
evoke the necessary stereotype of the evil American; and once more   
he considered this to be a moral shortcoming on his part.   
  
I felt resentful against the Americans, and believed that it was very in-   
human for a civilized country to commit such an evil deed. . . . But   
when many students in my class became very angry and made heated   
accusations against the American imperialists ... I found that I could   
not feel as angry as they did. . . . Perhaps it was because I could never   
experience a bloodthirsty image of an American. I had a bloodthirsty   
image of a Japanese soldier in my mind. ... of a cold, able, but in-   
human German. But 1 saw an American — though no longer easygoing,   
kindhearted and generous — still cheerful, openminded, and innocent.   
... I admitted that germ warfare was a fact, and I tried very hard to   
model a picture of the fierce American . . . but my impression of the   
innocent American never quite diminished. . . . But then I was   
ashamed of myself for not being emotional enough.   
  
Beyond these personal limitations, however, George was impressed   
with the effectiveness of the germ warfare agitation, not only in   
stirring up anti-American feeling and in rallying the Chinese people   
in a greater effort in the Korean war, but also in serving as a   
stimulus for a nationwide hygiene campaign, a campaign in which   
the students participated by laboring on improvement of their   

----------------------- Page 277-----------------------

university sewage and drainage systems.   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
During George's sophomore year, there were no major move-   
ments; but he experienced similar emotions in relationship to a   
continuing program of less dramatic thought reform measures. He   
did maintain a certain amount of emotional distance between him-   
self and the Communists: "I never deified the Party. ... I be-   
lieved in it, but I never could make myself love it." And especially   
during those rare moments when he was alone, he wondered   
whether Communism went too far in curbing personal freedom, or   
whether it was not being "unscientific" in its exaggeration and its   
claims of infallibility. But these doubts did not last: "I could not   
dare to believe that they were wrong and I was right." By the end   
of his second year at the university — and at the end of four years   
of Communist student life and reform — the Party had gained his   
trust and his allegiance: "I was completely confident in their   
theories. I trusted their program. . . . They seemed invincible.   
Emotionally speaking, I relied on them." Other students classified   
him as a "scholastic inactivist" — an outstanding student sufficiently   
progressive in his views but somewhat "lagging behind" in his   
enthusiasm and a bit "sentimental" about his family.   
  
When he was summoned to Hong Kong during his vacation be-   
cause of the death of his grandfather — his first family visit in two   
years — he thought the trip would be nothing more than an inter-   
lude before returning to an exciting future in Communist China,   
and he planned to be back in Peking at the University well before   
the next semester began. Indeed, he applied a "reformed" judg-   
ment to all that he saw in Hong Kong:   
  
I was hostile to the old society, and I looked upon the people in it with   
the eyes of an owl. I found myself unaccustomed to the capitalist way of   
life, and could not bear the vanity, waste, and extravagance of life here.   
... I resented differences and discrimination between rich and poor   
. . . well-to-do people enslaving their servants. ... I thought that I   
could openly and disinterestedly scorn and hate them, for I was so much   
superior to them.   
  
Yet within a few weeks he had reversed himself completely, this   
time not only in his point of view, but in his life plans. He decided to   
give up his university education on the mainland and remain in   
Hong Kong: again the influence of family members initiated a   
change of heart. He found his mother in an unhappy and "pitiable"   
  
THE CONVERSIONS OF YOUTH 327   
  
state; he felt "overwhelmed by affection" for her and unwilling to   
contemplate the pain he would cause her if he returned to the   
mainland. He also experienced feelings of guilt and responsibility   
toward a younger brother whom he had sometimes bullied during   

----------------------- Page 278-----------------------

childhood (one is responsible for one's younger brother in Chinese   
culture); and since this brother planned to study in Taiwan, George   
feared that if he returned to Peking he might never see him again.   
George described these family influences as "not rational, but   
rather emotional."   
  
Moreover, his older brother, to whom he had often looked for   
guidance in the past, was able to bring to bear upon him intellectual   
pressures as well. As an editor of an anti-Communist press service   
in Hong Kong, he made available to George a large number of   
books dealing with Western political theory, and presenting critical   
views of Russian Communism; these included a political biography   
of Lenin and a study of forced labor in the Soviet Union. George   
spent all of his waking hours reading; he was impressed by the works   
of Bertrand Russell, Arthur Lovejoy, and C. E. M. Joad, and was   
strongly affected by George Orwell's 1984: "I could compare this   
with my own experience on the mainland, and see that this was the   
logical eventual result of life under Communism."   
  
He developed a critical attitude toward Soviet Russia, and then   
a sense of mistrust for Chinese Communism, together with a more   
sympathetic view of the Western democratic tradition.   
  
While on the mainland, I had considered democracy as an age-old idea,   
outmoded — the capitalist world a corrupt and decadent one which must   
be historically eliminated within a short period. . . . But now I began   
to feel that things in the capitalist system were not as hopeless as the   
Communists said . . . that some form of socialism might be a desirable   
goal . . . but that in any case, we should not follow the road set by   
Communism — a road of revolution, violence, and killing. ... I re-   
evaluated my ideas about humanity, and the importance of liberalism. I   
also felt that the humanism derived from the tradition of the Italian   
Renaissance, and its skeptical spirit were much in contrast to the Com-   
munists and their fatalism. Their ideas about dialectical materialism   
seemed quite opposed to the scientific method and spirit.   
  
Similarly, he began to feel that the uncertain future of life in   
Hong Kong — with the possible hope of some day studying in Amer-   
ica — was more desirable than completing his university education   
  
328 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
and accepting a job assignment in Communist China. Having tasted   
a certain amount of this kind of exploration in ideas, he concluded   
that this was what he wanted, and had in fact always wanted:   
  
The whole atmosphere on the mainland did not encourage clear think-   
ing. But when I came out, I was able to read books, and permitted to   
think about things to a logical conclusion. I began to feel that I had no   
future in a society without this freedom. ... I concluded that I had   
always been latently hostile to the Communists and now my hostility   
could come out.   

----------------------- Page 279-----------------------

  
As might be expected, George went through a period of painful   
doubt and indecision, "a conflict of the two understandings." He   
also feared that the Communists might take over Hong Kong and   
force him to "face the consequences of my desertion." And even   
after making a formal promise to his parents that he would re-   
main, he was unable to quiet the turmoil which emanated from   
his unconscious mind as a series of dreams:   
  
In those ten days right after I had decided to remain here, I often — six   
or seven times— dreamed of getting back to the mainland. In the dreams,   
I was living with my classmates and talking with them as things used   
to be. In one dream I was at that very moment at the boundary of Hong   
Kong and China. I hoped to get back and something was preventing me   
from doing so. Suddenly I discovered that I had no document of admit-   
tance and I was in despair. Then I awoke. ... In another dream, I was   
back on the mainland, talking to several schoolmates, close friends, as   
we always did. Suddenly a thought came to me: what a narrow escape   
I had had in Hong Kong. I almost did not go back, and I was relieved to   
realize that I was back on the mainland. . . . Each time, before going   
to sleep, and on waking up in the morning, my decision to remain was   
definite. I was sure that I was here and that I wasn't going back. But in   
the dreams I lacked this understanding . . . and my thoughts were   
just like those that I had when I was really on the mainland.    
  
In associating to these dreams, George spoke of happy moments   
on the mainland — friendly talks with fellow students, visits to   
record stalls to listen to classical music. He also revealed the resent-   
ment which he felt toward his parents for their role in influencing   
his decision.   
  
When I awoke after one of these dreams, I actually resented my family   
a little. Going back to the mainland still at that moment seemed very   
desirable. . . . Then I thought of the promise I made to them that I   
  
THE CONVERSIONS OF YOUTH   
  
would stay. I made it first to my mother. . . . But with my father also   
— he is a very stubborn man — and once you promise him something, if   
you break it you have a very hard time. ... I felt then that the family   
would not let me break the promise — which was made originally because   
of their request. ... I felt it was giving me some kind of restriction,   
holding me back, causing me to lose my opportunity to study. ... I   
usually felt the resentment toward my father.   
  
George even admitted that he had been happier on the main-   
land than he was in Hong Kong "because of my friends there and   
the absence of financial worry."   
  
But before long, George settled into Hong Kong life, busying   
himself with studies at a local college, with editing and writing   
for an anti-Communist press organization, and with work on a   

----------------------- Page 280-----------------------

novel about his life in Communist China. Although he was con-   
vinced that he had made the correct decision, he was still disturbed   
by letters from friends on the mainland which criticized his action   
and referred to the exciting future for young men in Communist   
China. He was especially troubled by letters from one former class-   
mate with whom George had previously shared doubts about some   
Communist actions; this boy now wrote to him in a vein not un-   
critical of Communism, yet he still found fault with George for   
staying in Hong Kong.   
  
One year later, during the course of our interviews, George un-   
derwent still another period of painful indecision, and another   
sudden reversal of his plans. Having received little encouragement   
from American universities in response to his inquiries about   
scholarships, he decided to take advantage of an opportunity to   
study medicine in Taiwan, and achieved very high grades on an   
entrance examination he took in Hong Kong. But after booking   
his boat ticket, he spent two or three sleepless nights before the   
scheduled departure, tortured by fear and doubt. He felt com-   
pletely unable to undertake the trip. A family conference was   
called, and it was decided that since he was so fearful, he should   
cancel his plans. It was mainly the Communists whom he feared.   
  
The more I thought about going, the more fear I felt. . . . There was   
the fear of leaving my parents, but I realized that it wasn't this alone   
that led to my decision. I also feared the political situation on Taiwan   
. . . that it might be dangerous for someone who had been so long on   
the mainland to go there. . . . And I feared that the Communists may   
  
33° THOUGHT REFORM   
  
stop the ship and kidnap passengers as they did once on a ferry between   
Hong Kong and Macao. I feared that the Communists may come and   
take the island. ... I knew that my father's contacts could help if I   
were in trouble with the KMT — but with the Communists nothing could   
help. ... If they should come I had the feeling that I would lose all   
of my freedom and safety and might never see my family again. . . .   
This fear of the Communists was by far the most important factor in   
my decision.   
  
Once he and his family had decided he would not go, his sense   
of relief was immediate. He then weathered a certain amount of   
criticism from his father, who accused him of being "indecisive,"   
continued with his life in Hong Kong, and renewed his efforts to   
arrange study in America. In discussing this incident with me, he   
emphasized that he had never experienced this kind of fear of the   
Communists during the years that he actually lived under them.   
  
Toward the end of our meetings, George talked freely of the   
development of his personal philosophy and his quest for the mean-   
ing of life. He described his earliest convictions — derived from his   
own childhood experiences, and from reading the tragic love poetry   

----------------------- Page 281-----------------------

from the T'ang and Sung dynasties — of the "futility of life"; its   
replacement by a religious belief that "the meaning of life could   
be the glorification of God"; and after having been disillusioned   
with this, finding very compelling the Communist claim that "the   
purpose of life is to serve the people." After his break with Com-   
munism, he remained concerned with this problem, but came to   
look upon it in terms of man's relationship to his individual   
existence:   
  
In all these previous concepts I thought that the purpose of life was   
something definite that you could grasp. Now I know that this is not so.   
I am inclined to believe that the purpose of life has to do with what   
degree you have carried out your aims and ideals . . . your responsibili-   
ties to your own thoughts and feelings.   
  
He illustrated his personal change through his altered idea of   
the hero :   
  
If I had daydreams now, they would still be different from that of my   
childhood. Then it was a person of great heroic grandeur; now I think   
of perfection of ability and of moral sentiments . . . unselfishness, dis-   
interestedness, honesty to others and to oneself.   
  
THE CONVERSIONS OF YOUTH 331   
  
George retained his emphasis upon the inner man, contrasting   
this with the Communist ethos as he saw it:   
  
In their opinion there is nothing beyond the material. They have no   
recognition of spirit. They think there is no need for artistic search and   
for beauty. I cannot agree with this. ... I believe that human beings   
need all kinds of satisfaction, of material feelings and of spirit. When   
you eat something you are satisfied. But when it is over and you think   
of the act of eating, there is no more satisfaction. But if you have emo-   
tional satisfaction or emotional sympathy for something, then even on   
reflection you still feel that satisfaction or sympathy. All of the satis-   
faction that can be retained by reflection in retrospect belongs to your   
inner feelings, and these are most valuable.   
  
George was critical of Communist attitudes toward family rela-   
tionships, especially that between mother and son:   
  
They said that even the relationship of a mother and son is a relation-   
ship of economic interest . . . that when a mother was very fond of   
her son who was rich, after he was broke, she would treat him badly.   
. . . My own experience didn't lead me to think of such economic   
factors between mother and son. ... I had doubts about their theory,   
but I could not then fully disagree with them. . . . Now I realize that   
they have a complete ignorance of the power of moral standards and of   
human emotion. . . . They have no recognition of personal feelings.   
  
During the course of his stay in Hong Kong, George gradually   

----------------------- Page 282-----------------------

reintegrated himself into the pattern of his family, somewhat in the   
fashion of a traditional Chinese son. He and his father became   
more moderate in their behavior toward each other, and George be-   
gan to feel "a little apologetic" over past disrespectful behavior.   
He adopted a policy of "outwardly agreeing with everything father   
says," avoiding conflict wherever possible, and — despite his con-   
tinued reservations — making every effort to accept his father as the   
"moral authority" in the family. George extended his concern for   
personal morality to the behavior of others: he criticized a female   
cousin for what he considered to be indiscriminate behavior with   
men, and even called his older brother to task for spending a great   
deal of time with a girl friend at the expense of scholarly pursuits.   
He remained equally strict with himself in his disciplined life of   
writing and study, although he too began to demonstrate an in-   
creasing, if shy and hesitant, interest in girls.   
  
332 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
When I saw him during my follow-up visit three years later, he   
had become a confident youth in his mid-twenties, and had im-   
proved his English enough for us to dispense with an interpreter.   
He no longer wished to discuss in any detail his mainland ex-   
periences, and preferred to look ahead to his study in America, hav-   
ing almost completed visa and scholarship arrangements. His family   
had already moved to the United States. But once more there had   
been a change in his plans: no longer a student of science, he was   
perhaps following his more natural bent in pursuing a program in   
literature and dramatics.   
  
Compared with Chao's and Hu's, George Chen's thought reform   
had initially been more successful; but his family identifications,   
more consistently binding than theirs, played a large part in un-   
doing these reform influences. Neither a perpetual rebel nor a   
frustrated careerist, George Chen was an impressionable youngster   
torn between youth group and family loyalties, the first of which   
offered a path to Chinese Communism, and the second the possi-   
bility of a liberal alternative.   
  
In his sequence of identity patterns, George covered less emo-   
tional distance than either Chao or Hu. Coming from an urban,   
somewhat Westernized background, and having spent part of his   
childhood in the British colony of Hong Kong, he had experienced   
a good deal less of traditional Chinese life. Like the others he was   
brought up to be a filial son, obedient to his elders, loyal to his   
family. But as a member of a younger, more "modem" generation,   
he had fewer Confucian influences to contend with, and had from   
the beginning been exposed to a compromise Chinese- Western   
family atmosphere. This, along with his family's opportunity to   
keep together, gave him a greater sense of cultural continuity than   
either Chao or Hu: less "Chinese" to begin with, he had less need   
to break with his Chinese past. Offered love and support from his   
family, his filialism, compared to Hu's, was neither a pseudo iden-   

----------------------- Page 283-----------------------

tity nor an archaic one.   
  
Yet George too felt the chaos of his society and the effects of   
strained family relationships. As a weak, dislocated, and dependent   
child, he was aware early of his refugee status; he needed more   
nurturing than was available, and developed a psychological escape   
into illness. His infantile depression at the time of the departure   
  
THE CONVERSIONS OF YOUTH 333   
  
of his first amah was the prototype of a later tendency toward de-   
pression and despair. 2 As a melancholy isolate, he developed an un-   
dercurrent of introspective brooding and a keen sense for the sad-   
ness of life. Far from incapacitating him, however, these qualities   
contributed to a rich inner life to which he later clung tenaciously.   
And they also became associated with a personal pattern of death   
and rebirth — a tendency to hit rock bottom in despairing inde-   
cision and doubt, and then to emerge strengthened by his own   
inwardness.   
  
Like Hu, George longed for the return of an absent father; and   
he too built up personal myths in which he was hero and redeemer.   
But in contrast to Hu, these myths did not involve vengeance   
and retaliation toward hated family members; rather, they con-   
tained the filial wish to deliver both the family and himself from   
positions of shame and weakness. And he found his means of per-   
sonal deliverance, not through heroic action, but by continuing to   
turn inward, by developing — as a creative seeker — the artist's urge   
for self-expression as well as the scientist's urge to know. Such crea-   
tive urges, whatever their origins and whatever suffering may accom-   
pany them, contribute to a sense of identity which transcends one's   
immediate environment, even one's culture. Both the artist and the   
scientist in George were involved in his search for the meaning of   
life. However immature and unstable this quest may have been, it   
was at least his own, and it required him to weigh every experience   
against standards that were both personal and universal.   
  
In his early teens, George became both a romantic and a moralist.   
These two sides of him were symbolized in his description of his   
two grandmothers — one a spontaneous and affectionate lover of   
nature, the other a stern (and personally wronged) representative   
of God's most severe judgments. We cannot, of course, claim that   
these ladies were entirely responsible for shaping the two identities.   
But grandparents have a strong influence within a Chinese family,   
even when they preach a Western Christian message; and there is   
no doubt that they played an important part in bringing out these   
two potential aspects of George's character. The romantic in him   
thrived upon sensation, craving an idealized world of beautiful   
words, sights and feelings. The moralist in him condemned these   
very yearnings, both in himself and in others; it was guilt-ridden,   
judging, ever on guard against temptation. For it was compounded    
  

----------------------- Page 284-----------------------

334 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
of a sensitive child's susceptibilities to shame and guilt (including   
the probable childhood fantasy that he was in some way responsible   
for such catastrophes as his amah's departure and the family's dis-   
location); of Christian notions of sin and evil, and of Confucian-   
derived standards of personal propriety. The moralist in him con-   
demned his father, on the basis of both the latter's real short-   
comings and George's intolerance for a rival for his cherished   
mother. And the moralist in him also kept a steady and critical   
eye on the activities of all other family members as well.   
  
On the subjects of sex and religion, the romantic and the moralist   
joined forces. Feeling guilty and ashamed about his sensual urges,    
George found sanction (incomplete, but meaningful all the same)   
in D. H. Lawrence's hymn of praise to the sensual, in a novel which   
has been described as expressing "Lawrence's romantic religious,   
antinomian, ecstatic faith that sex is holy." 3 George's early attrac-   
tion to Christianity reflects both the moralist's need for responsible   
doctrine and relief of guilt, and the romantic's quest for eternal   
beauty and eternal meaning.   
  
It is as the romantic moralist, then, that George judged both the   
declining Nationalist regime and the oncoming Communists. He   
condemned the immorality of the former although retaining his   
family-based emotional loyalty for it. But very quickly after the   
onset of Communist thought reform, he experienced a romantic   
conversion against a dimly-lit background, with lonely and mystical   
overtones. Also involved was the romantic's need to submit to the   
natural elements, since George felt strongly Communism's claim   
to be the wave of the future.   
  
In comparing George's approach to Communism with Hu's,   
George was more the visionary and less the political activist, more   
the inner man (or boy) and less the power seeker. But George   
shared with Hu the extremely important urge, so characteristic of   
youth everywhere during our era, to find group acceptance and an   
emotional home among his peers. Both used this acceptance to free   
themselves from family controls and enter into manhood. George   
too had his political mentor, the rational and giving instructor,   
who contrasted sharply with the irrational and self-centered (or   
absent) father of George's childhood. Like Hu (and like Dr. Vin-   
cent) George was an isolate who craved intimacy with other people;   
unlike either of them, he had known enough love in his life to have   
  
THE CONVERSIONS OF YOUTH 335   
  
become quite capable of achieving this intimacy.   
  
As the modern student, George felt a strong urge to remain in   
step with his fellow students and his country. George did not, like   
Hu, seek in Communism an outlet for personal hostilities; he felt,   

----------------------- Page 285-----------------------

in fact, the need to repress these hostilities, both toward his family   
and the Communists themselves. This nonhostile compliance may   
be regarded as an inability to tolerate conscious resentment, but it   
is also related to a pattern of receptivity frequently present in creative   
people: a tendency to open oneself completely to new influences as   
a way of knowing them. It is also the romantic's eternal quest for an   
atmosphere of love.   
  
These tendencies are part of the reason George was such a peren-   
nial backslider, why he underwent so many conversions and counter-   
conversions. There were no less than six of these in relation to Com-   
munism, both for and against, and still another in his earlier re-   
sponse to Christianity. Any explanation must be, as usual, overdeter-   
mined, and must be based on both George's personal character   
and on the historical and cultural circumstances. The most obvious   
factor, but a very important one, was that his family had re-estab-   
lished itself in Hong Kong, the scene of so much of his childhood,   
and had once more assumed a collective refugee identity. These cir-   
cumstances not only created a reason for George to travel back and   
forth, but gave him an emotional sense of living in two separate   
homes, of having two distinct centers — or, to put it another way,   
of commuting between the two identities of the filial son and the   
modern student. Moreover, at the time of these journeys, George   
was an adolescent, going through the stage of life during which   
conversions are most natural, identity experiments most necessary,   
and Utopian visions most appealing. More than this, he was a   
Chinese adolescent, who although modern and Western in his   
direction, was still emotionally tied to traditional Chinese notions   
of propriety and harmony. Both in denouncing his parents to ful-   
fill Communist requirements, and in giving up a career in Com-   
munist China in response to family loyalties, he felt he was doing   
the proper thing under the circumstances, adapting himself to the   
demands of a group which had just claims upon his allegiance.   
  
Then, too, the nature of the Communist demands was such that   
they always carried with them the potential for rebound. Even   
among the most rebellious of Chinese youth, filial identifications   
  
336 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
were likely to reappear. One public denunciation cannot wipe out   
four thousand years of filial ethos. The potential for backsliding   
would always be there, especially if the environment supports it, and   
most especially in the company of parents.   
  
In view of all this, one could hardly expect any Chinese youngster   
to steer a perfectly straight identity course. But two features of   
George's personal character — his unusually strong dependency needs   
and his pattern of ambivalence — made him especially susceptible to   
vacillation. His ties to his mother (she too was indecisive), and his   
guilt and shame-filled sentiments toward his father and brother (for   
unfilial acts or thoughts) made it impossible for him to cast off   

----------------------- Page 286-----------------------

family attachments. Yet his equally compelling quest for group be-   
longing made it almost impossible for him to live up to them. Never   
having felt himself to be fully nurtured in an emotional sense (and   
perhaps constitutionally in need of an unusual amount of nurturing,   
of a very special kind), George tended to hold on to those things   
which had nourished him, and to waver between choices when   
something had to be given up.   
  
Here again is the death-and-rebirth pattern previously men-   
tioned. In each of George's conversions and counterconversions   
there was a somewhat depressive tendency: a pattern of mourn-   
ing, preoccupation with and guilt toward the lost object, and a need   
for a working through of these emotions before he could enjoy the   
fruits of the actual conversion. But perhaps of greater significance   
was George's capacity to enter into a variety of personal ideological   
experiences and still retain a strong core of self. Never prone to a   
totalism like Hu's, his stress upon his own inner life — his creative   
urge to experience and to know — buffered him against complete   
self-surrender, and helped to preserve his personal identity. George   
resembled Professor Castorp in his seemingly submissive tendency   
to give up so much of himself while really holding on to what was   
most vital. His unusually strong urge toward self-realization enabled   
him to use his conversions to enhance his own intellectual and   
emotional development.   
  
Although George's family ties were undoubtedly the crucial   
factor in his decision to remain in Hong Kong, he was able to take   
advantage of these to reawaken parts of himself (especially his urge   
to know) which had been temporarily stifled under Communism.   
Nonetheless his over-all responses make it clear that, had there been   
  
THE CONVERSIONS OF YOUTH 337   
  
a bit more pressure from the other direction, he might well have   
made the opposite decision. Not only did he resent his parents for   
their part in separating him from the appealing group life within   
China, but he also partially condemned himself for succumbing   
to their influence and deserting the vast team effort in which he had   
been involved. The full effects of the hold which the Com-   
munists had upon him were apparent in his sudden decision to   
abandon plans to study in Taiwan: this hold was the combination   
of residual fear and guilt also observed in Hu and in most Western   
subjects as well (it must also be remembered that at the time the   
Communists were threatening to "liberate" Taiwan through mili-   
tary action). Even here, however, George's identity-preserving,   
creative urges probably had some importance, joining with his fear   
and guilt in steering him to better opportunities for his own self-   
expression.   
  
It is interesting to note the interplay of identity and ideology   
which finally took shape within George. He called forth his most   
basic components, with the emphasis on compromise alignments.   

----------------------- Page 287-----------------------

He partially returned to filial obligations (going as far as he felt   
capable in this direction) in adapting himself to his father's au-   
thority, even if with inner reservations. At the same time, he main-   
tained group ties and kept his identity of the modern student and   
patriot active: through further study in Hong Kong, through work   
with anti-Communist press organizations, and in his plans to study   
in America. Thus he maintained both traditional and modern   
Chinese influences in taking on the ideology of democratic liberal-   
ism. At different times, he continued to express attitudes of the   
moralist, the romantic, and the rational scientist. But the effective   
combination of this array of different identities marks the emergence   
of the creative artist in George. While this identity is far from   
the most "practical" for his American future, it seems to be the one   
most precious to him.   
  
CHAPTER   
  
GRACE WU: MUSIC AND REFORM   
  
What of the experiences of young Chinese women?   
  
The last case I shall discuss is that of a female musi-   
cian whose thought reform took place during four years of attend-   
ance at two universities.   
  
Grace Wu was one of the few Chinese subjects I was able to   
interview within a few weeks after arrival in Hong Kong. Although   
she had fled from her reform, and had lived quietly at home for   
more than a year before she left China, she had by no means re-   
covered from its emotional effects at the time that a mutual ac-   
quaintance made arrangements for our first interview. A tense and   
intelligent girl of twenty-four, with sharp features, wearing steel-   
rimmed glasses, she looked both determined and fragile. She   
dressed neatly, but not in a particularly feminine manner. With a   
more Westernized background than any of the Chinese subjects   
previously described, her English was fluent. The combination of   
her Westernized upbringing and her agitated emotional state swept   
away cultural barriers. She plunged into her story without hesita-   
tion because she had a great need to tell it, and to understand what   
had happened to her. The freshness of her material and her desire   
for therapy increased her resemblance to my Western subjects. We   
had thirteen sessions, totalling about twenty-eight hours, and the last   
part of our work together was more like psychotherapy than any-   
thing else.

GRACE WD: MUSIC AND REFORM 339   
  
The daughter of a customs official (in a customs service separate   
from the Chinese government, for many years run by foreigners)   
Grace grew up in the cosmopolitan treaty port cities of Tientsin and   

----------------------- Page 288-----------------------

Shanghai. Her father, whom she described as "not too strong," had   
in later years entered private business without great success, and   
was frequently unemployed. She spoke of her mother as a more   
dominant influence and at the same time a more sympathetic   
person. Mrs. Wu's father had been a Protestant minister, and she   
was not only deeply concerned with imbuing in her daughter her   
own values, but also wished to develop in Grace a capacity beyond   
her own to realize these values — in religion, in education, and   
especially in music. When Grace began to show outstanding musi-   
cal talent, after beginning to study piano at the age of five, her   
mother did everything to encourage its development. Mrs. Wu was   
easily upset, however, and always nervous; and Grace as a child   
showed similar characteristics: "I was more quiet than other girls.   
I was more nervous, and scared easily. I was mentally not strong."   
  
During much of Grace's childhood, the family lived under the   
Japanese occupation, and these were hard times. Her father lost   
his job, and was even arrested and briefly detained by the Japanese.   
Mr. Wu felt that because of the family's difficult straits Grace   
should give up her musical studies. She has always remained grate-   
ful to her mother for insisting that she be permitted to continue.   
Grace was absorbed in her music, playing, listening, and reading   
biographies of great musicians. She also did some painting, and   
when she began to attend missionary schools, she became interested   
in dramatics and in journalism. But she avoided social activities,   
and continued to spend a good deal of time alone.   
  
During her teens, Grace faced a series of personal dilemmas relat-   
ing to family, friends, sex, religion, and music — and also to her strug-   
gles to make sense out of a distressing torrent of emotions. She re-   
garded her friends' interest in boys as frivolous, and felt "disgust"   
when she herself was approached by a boy. Rather than displaying   
conventional Chinese female shyness, she was frequently outspoken   
and aggressive, and this led to considerable friction with her female   
classmates. She wanted to transfer from her secondary school to a   
special music school, but this time even her mother opposed her,   
insisting that she acquire a strong general education. Her father   
was of little help and expressed only mild disapproval of both musi-   
  
34° THOUGHT REFORM   
  
cal training and of the missionary school (he was not a Christian)   
which she was already attending. Since "mother was strong-willed,"   
it was mother's decision which prevailed.   
  
Inwardly, she was torn between her quests for both musical pas-   
sion and religious calm, regarding the two emotions as incompatible:   
  
I felt strongly for religion . . . but I felt it was in conflict with   
music. . . . You are born with emotions that should be changed by   
religion. But in music, people must use real emotions and express them.   
... An artist must have strong feeling. . . . Music requires emotions   

----------------------- Page 289-----------------------

which religion condemns — such as passion and hate. ... In religion   
this would be sinful, you have to hold them back. ... I talked to the   
minister about it and to others, but I got no good answer. . . . The   
minister and the musician said opposite things. ... I had to postpone   
this problem.   
  
Overwhelmed on all sides, Grace experienced at the age of   
eighteen what she described as a "breakdown," with both physical   
and psychological symptoms:   
  
My health failed. I collapsed. I was in bed for one year. ... It was   
in my lung and I was told it would develop into TB if I wasn't careful.   
The symptoms were weakness and I tired easily. I stayed in bed for one   
year. I got up a little in the afternoons. I was weak and I had fever. I   
spent the time reading and listening to the radio.   
  
She recognized that emotional elements were important in her   
illness, and she thought these were the product of her own evil:   
  
The feeling I had then was that I was selfish. ... I couldn't get what   
I wanted so I felt different from others, angry and frustrated. . . . Now   
I realize that I created these feelings . . . inside of myself.   
  
But her illness was not without its rewards:   
  
After one or two months I got used to it. Friends came to visit once in a   
while. People are nice to you when you are sick.   
  
Returning to senior high school after a year of absence, Grace   
continued her journalistic interests and was caught up in postwar   
political currents. At first she had been excited by the restoration   
of Chinese sovereignty and the end of the Japanese occupation;   
but like most of her fellow students, she soon became disillusioned   
  
GRACE WU: MUSIC AND REFORM   
  
34 1   
  
with the Nationalist regime, and condemned its use of personal   
privilege and "squeeze." She contributed her share of critical state-   
ments about the government to the student newspaper, and in-   
fluenced by a few enthusiastic Communist students, she began,   
with many classmates, to take an interest in Russian writers and   
in other Communist programs. She was just finishing high school at   
the time of the Communist takeover. Although she had heard   
stories of Communist atrocities ("their killing church congregations,   
taking anything they wanted, acting like monsters"), she shared   
the general feeling of sympathy and expectation:   
  
We students had lost hope in the Nationalists. We welcomed the   
Communists. . . . We waited to see and felt that they might be better.   
I was of the young generation and looked forward to change and im-   

----------------------- Page 290-----------------------

provement.   
  
The Communists' exemplary behavior seemed at first to support   
these expectations. Grace and her friends were impressed by the   
discipline of their armies ("the Chinese saying, 'Good men do not   
become soldiers' did not seem to be true of these men"), and with   
the initial atmosphere of freedom.   
  
A few months later, Grace entered a local missionary college as a   
journalism major, bowing to her parents' insistence that she re -   
main at home (this time her father had his say) because of the   
uncertain political situation, rather than attend a university in   
Peking where a music course was available. Her journalistic work    
first brought her into contact with Communist pressures, and her   
earliest response was one of confusion:   
  
We were told not to see things from the university's viewpoint, but from   
the people's viewpoint — to always think of the common people. . . .   
The Communists tried to organize everything, and since we never came   
across anything that we knew the answer to beforehand, we were quite   
confused. They failed a student whom they didn't want in power. . . .   
They were not satisfied with the facts, and would only want us to print   
certain items, telling us, "The paper is to educate people . . . not sim-   
ply to bring news." At first we spoke in a straightforward manner, but   
later we learned not to.   
  
Soon intensive political studies were inaugurated, as well as the   
beginning of a program of student thought reform. Despite her dis-   
  
342 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
comfort, Grace began to come under Communist influence, an   
influence which, in retrospect, she considered pernicious:   
  
They are careful at first to do things step by step, gradually . . . you   
don't feel guilty [about following the Communist line] because they   
explain it all to you. You feel you are doing a big thing. They make a   
standard for you to follow and you say that I am doing things right   
according to their standard .... If you once believe in them, it's   
natural to go on believing. . . . It's just like poisoning ... it goes   
deeper and deeper.   
  
As the pressures mounted, Grace began to feel increasingly   
anxious. As an editor of the school paper, she attended a large   
number of meetings and was generally in the center of these new   
activities. She began to become painfully aware of restrictions upon   
personal freedom and of tightening controls — especially when a   
prominent newspaper had its publication suspended for three days   
for stating that North Korea had invaded South Korea. She became   
increasingly critical of the Communists: "I gradually began to feel   
that what they said was not what I thought. I was disappointed in   
the Communists and had a strong feeling of dissatisfaction." She   

----------------------- Page 291-----------------------

felt it necessary to extricate herself from a threatening situation,   
and to choose a field of study other than journalism.   
  
She decided to take advantage of a promise made earlier to her   
by her parents, that, should she become dissatisfied with journalism,   
she would be permitted to return to her musical studies. During   
her sophomore year, she arranged to transfer to Yenching University   
in Peking, one of China's major institutions of higher learning, and   
one with long-established American missionary and educational   
associations. 1 There, in a class of twenty-five music majors, she   
studied in a department run by three professors, two American and   
one Chinese. She worked hard and made progress in her musical   
development. She was especially close to one of the American   
professors, Mr. Moore, and came to value both his musical guidance   
and his friendship. During her lessons with him, they discussed not   
only music, but also philosophy and to some extent the immediate   
problems of life in Communist China. She felt greatly inspired by   
him and developed for him "an affection ... a kind of love." As   
the atmosphere began to tighten, however, she noted that he and   
all of the other American professors were being repeatedly de-   
nounced at student meetings, and she advised him to leave the   
  
GRACE WU: MUSIC AND REFORM 343   
  
country for the sake of his personal safety.   
  
During the winter of 1951-52, a little more than a year after her   
transfer, Grace was suddenly put in a situation much more pain-   
ful than any she had yet experienced at either of the universities.   
Until this time, she had managed to avoid trouble by burying her-   
self in her work and doing nothing antagonistic to the Communist   
program; she was considered a promising musician, if politically   
"a bit lagging behind." But now she was approached by a newly   
appointed and highly "progressive" Chinese music instructor who   
began to exert strong pressures on her, first to inform upon Mr.   
Moore, and later to denounce him publicly as a "reactionary." She   
became embroiled in a series of demands and threats, which she   
somehow managed to resist:   
  
He told me that this was to be a big movement, and that it was my   
chance to have a bright future. He said I should try to search out Mr.   
Moore's faults and then come back and tell him about them. He said   
that since I was friendly with Mr. Moore, I could give important infor-   
mation about him. ... He said that this was a challenge, and if I   
accepted it I would be safe. ... I told him I did not want to do any-   
thing which I didn't believe in, and that I didn't think that things   
should be done this way. I said that Mr. Moore was an American and   
was not "progressive," but there was nothing more I could tell him. He   
said, "You are not smart. You won't have a bright future in spite of   
being a good musician. . . ."   
  
Weeks later, I heard that the police had taken Mr. Moore's cook into   

----------------------- Page 292-----------------------

custody, and again the new teacher came to me. He said, "The cook has   
confessed, and now it is your turn. I give you three days. Otherwise you   
might go to prison or to labor reform. If you do confess, you will get a   
new life." I was startled, I didn't know if the cook had confessed or what   
he confessed. Moore had told me I could say anything about him since   
he was safe as a foreigner, while I could get into trouble. I had no one   
to consult during this time. I knew that if I did say anything, I could   
start anew, but I knew it would be bad for Moore. I believed that what   
they said was not true, so I did not want to say anything. The students   
were against me, as they felt I knew something I wasn't telling. . . .   
For two nights, I could not sleep. I made the decision not to say any-   
thing. At the end of two days, I went to them. I said I could not confess   
an untruth. . . . Finally they admitted that they had not gotten the   
cook and he had not confessed and I was allowed to leave.   
  
This incident — which extended over several months — took its emo-   
tional toll.   
  
344 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
At this time my nerves were shot. I got neurotic diarrhea. I could never   
relax. It got worse. They were suspicious of me and the doctor said I was   
neurotic. They asked me why I was so nervous. I asked for sick leave   
at the hospital for one week and got it. The diarrhea stopped and I went   
back to school . . . but I knew I had won.   
  
I realized that I must go. They hadn't got me this time, but the next   
time they would. I was also worried about Moore. I asked a boy student   
to take a walk on campus with me. If I went with a girl it would look   
more suspicious than being with a boy. We went past Moore's house,   
and I heard him playing so that I knew he was not in prison. I saw a   
policeman there who was watching his house. From the way he played a   
Chopin waltz I knew he was upset. He never played like that ordinarily.   
I left without his knowing I had been there.   
  
Grace was also disturbed by much else that went on during the   
general thought reform movement, which was compounded of the   
"Three Anti" and "Honesty and Frankness" campaigns.   
  
She felt "disgusted" by what she considered to be the Party's   
view toward love and sex:   
  
If a boy was interested in someone, he would check with the Party to   
see if it was all right to be in love. Then if the Party gave the go-ahead,   
he would go to the girl and say, "So-and-so, I am interested in you. Can   
we develop?" The girl would then give an answer, "We can try." Three   
weeks later they would announce that they were lovers. If the girl would   
say, "I cannot develop," he would continue arguing and returning. The   
girl is supposed to be honored if a progressive person asks for her   
love. ... If she spurns a progressive man, the Party will come and   
talk to her. If she has a good reason, the Party will give in or they   
will ask if there is some way the man might change to be acceptable.   

----------------------- Page 293-----------------------

. . . Many girls have babies. At first a pregnancy was news, but later   
it was not. They would say, "Sooner or later, they will be married, so   
what does it matter?" They made love a kind of business.   
  
She was both shocked and impressed when the president of the   
university was publicly denounced by his own daughter.   
  
The president of our university had three children, two sons and one   
daughter. The Communists went to them and asked them to help   
against their father. The sons refused. The daughter was a graduate of   
the physics department doing research work. They went to her and told   
her that her father, Dr. Lu, was a traitor. . . . They persuaded the   
daughter to accuse him during a small meeting. It was very dramatic.   
She cried and shouted, called him by his first name. He sat there with   
  
GRACE WU: MUSIC AND REFORM 345   
  
his head lowered and was very ashamed of her. Her mother was there   
and cried. Her father had been a doctor of psychology and was sixty   
years old. The daughter was so successful that they put her in a large   
meeting of the whole student body and she repeated her accusations.   
Everyone began to listen to her and her father's reputation now began   
to fall. 2   
  
Grace described the special exhibits at which letters from the   
university president's files were displayed, demonstrating his Amer-   
ican connections and his alleged part in making Yenching a "stub-   
born castle of reaction." Student guides took other students around   
the exhibit and explained "why we are poisoned here at Yenching,"   
always ending their tour with the impassioned conclusion: "There   
is no way out but reforming. Hate your past, and you will find your   
way for the future."   
  
In music, Communist attitudes violated her aesthetic standards,   
and greatly confused her.   
  
The Communists called modern Western music unhealthy. . . . We   
had many meetings on this. . . . They wanted a new form of music.   
. . . Modem music is too abstract and uncontrolled for them. French   
composers like Debussy they feel are unhealthy for the people. They say   
that this music gives the people queer thoughts and funny ideas. That   
if we listen to Debussy we will feel as though we are under water or   
watching the sea. They say that since there is really nothing like this,   
we will begin to think abnormally. ... To them anything fantastic or   
abstract is abnormal and unhealthy. . . . They wanted us to learn folk   
songs and folk dances, to go among the common people who need   
healthy recreation. . . . They liked songs that named all of the histori-   
cal figures — like Mao. They said that these songs enable people to get   
educated with a healthy spirit. ... I couldn't find a solution. ... I   
thought, maybe their music was healthy, but it was not inspired.   
  
She noticed that many of the other music students also had   

----------------------- Page 294-----------------------

difficulty absorbing these policies. Some became so involved with   
meetings and reform activity that they did not have enough time to   
practice; others were in such psychological distress that they could   
not play; and many vocal students thought their voices unsuitable   
for folk songs. The authorities recognized that "thought problems"   
were likely to be particularly common among music students be-   
cause of their artistic sensitivities, and usually approached them with   
a certain amount of delicacy, allowing for individual variations. The   
  
346 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
net result was that Grace saw almost everybody around her succumb-   
ing to the thought reform program:   
  
My friends changed their minds after a while. . . . They really did.   
They tried to give me advice. They told me that when they had believed   
in Western music, they were merely looking at life from the narrow   
standpoint of their own personal enjoyment. They found that the coun-   
try people enjoy folk music, and that there modern music was not wel-   
come. What is most important, they said, was that somebody appreciated   
their music. Sooner or later we must change our minds, they said, and   
it is easier to do it now. There were others who hadn't believed strongly   
in their own music, and they changed right away. Almost everyone   
changed. I began to wonder what was right.   
  
At first, there were at least ten people who were strongly against the   
Communists. But gradually, as the pressure mounted, they turned over.   
. . . They would say, "Why should I lean on decayed theory?" They   
read only Communist books, saw things only from that point of view,   
and when they had a conflict they went to a Party member for advice.   
Some went over without a struggle, but even those with strong con-   
victions finally gave up and went over to the Communist side.   
  
She felt increasingly isolated, out of step with all that was going   
on around her. Her difficulty was that she could neither completely   
deny to herself the validity of what the Communists were putting   
forward, nor wholeheartedly go along with it.   
  
I was very confused. ... I felt lonely. ... I wanted to keep putting   
off the problem, to not think of it until the next day. At times they   
seemed reasonable by their logic and theory. You got so you had to think   
back on your own logic and theory to understand how you really felt.   
... I found it hard to be alone with all the world on the other side.   
You feel like a stranger in that environment if you don't go over.   
  
Singled out for much special attention, she was constantly   
accused of having a "technical point of view":   
  
I was a hard worker, and was criticized for being seven hours at the piano   
and only two hours at the meetings. They said, "To you there is nothing   
but a piano. Think of the millions of your country's people."   
  

----------------------- Page 295-----------------------

She observed the other's confessions and conformed to the ex-   
tent she thought necessary, but she did not always have complete   
control of her feelings.   
  
GRACE WU: MUSIC AND REFORM   
  
347   
  
The secret in writing a confession is to make up your mind what your   
deficiency is in their thinking. You won't get past this otherwise, unless   
you understand what they want to hear. ... I made several points. You   
always need several points. ... I said that before I was too much in   
music, and now I will do the work that people want me to do, be more   
practical and less technical in my approach. . . . That I despised Chi-   
nese music before, but now I have a new appreciation of it and hate   
Western music, that I must learn to love Chinese music and do my best   
with it. . . . That in the past I was unable to tell the difference between   
my friends and my enemies, that I trusted certain persons like Mr.   
Moore but now I know I should not have, and that I should be more   
careful in the future. . . . That before I was isolated from the group   
and interested only in my own work, not interested in concentrating on   
the people whom I should be representing, but only on myself, and that   
now I would spend more time with the other students. . . . But after   
you have made all of these points, sometimes you wonder if you have   
been acting all of this or not.   
  
Yet despite her concessions, she resisted active participation.   
When she was asked to play the accordion before labor or peasant   
groups, she insisted it was too heavy for her; and her one attempt   
to play before a group of workers was a fiasco.   
  
After the first piece they didn't know enough to applaud. On the second   
piece they applauded at a pause. I stopped and they stopped. I started   
and they began to applaud again. I got mad. I refused to play to the   
ignorant workers. The Communists tried to apologize, saying, "We had   
no idea they were so uneducated."   
  
She also retained a strong inner resistance to the conversion that   
was demanded of her.   
  
I had no idea of what would happen to me, but I thought I would   
rather give up my future than change. . . . What prevented me from   
turning over was a kind of belief. I believed that the world could not   
be like this.   
  
Grace could not stand up under these pressures, however, and   
once more began to react with frequent bouts of diarrhea and other   
psychogenic symptoms.   
  
I began to be sick quite often and this made them suspicious. . . .   
An activist came to my room and asked about my health. I said I get   
tired if I work too much. He asked me if I was really too busy, or if there   

----------------------- Page 296-----------------------

was something on my mind, something in the subconscious which I   
  
348 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
didn't know. He said: "You must have been poisoned from so many   
years in missionary schools . . . maybe you are not open enough. We   
will try to solve things with you. We know you will change."   
  
Her symptoms continued, and became especially severe after   
some inoculations in connection with the alleged American bacte-   
riological warfare threat. 8   
  
Everyone was compelled to take injections against the germ warfare. . . .   
In Peking we were the first to get them. . . . There were four things   
combined in an injection but I am not sure what they were. . . . They   
were very strong and many people died. Because I was so nervous and   
upset the nurse told me she was only giving me half. But I had two days   
or fever from it and then some heart trouble. My pulse was one hundred   
and twenty and one hundred thirty. I didn't know what was happening.   
The doctor said it was a reaction to the injection. I decided that I must   
get away.   
  
She continued to feel ill for weeks afterward. At the end of that   
semester, although she needed only one more term to graduate, she   
decided to apply for sick leave from the university, pressing her case   
with an insistence that would not be denied:   
  
At first the school doctors would not write my excuse. I went to the   
infirmary almost every day so that they would know I was sick. ... I   
was determined to go. Finally they granted me sick leave for six months.   
  
Almost immediately after she got home, she went to see a doctor   
who was also an old friend of the family. He told her that her ill-   
ness was psychological, due to the "shock" from the injection and   
the general tension of the situation she was in. He advised her to   
"go away someplace where you don't have to think so much."   
Grace was not certain whether this was indirect advice to leave the   
country, but she was in any case hoping to do so.   
  
Her family situation in Tientsin was far from calm: her father   
had lost his job; her mother was in the midst of a "nervous break-   
down," easily excitable and unable to sleep; and her younger brother   
and sister were also both home on sick leave, with illnesses ap-   
parently related to physical and emotional pressures of their work   
environments. Grace was particularly upset to find that her parents   
were not completely sympathetic with her antagonism to the new   
regime. At first they advised Grace to make a greater effort to get   
  
GRACE WU: MUSIC AND REFORM 349   
  
along with the Communists; and only later, after they themselves   
had had difficulty, did they come around to her point of view.   

----------------------- Page 297-----------------------

  
Despite her problems, she managed to "rest, relax, and rebuild   
myself," during the year she spent at home, at the same time con-   
tinuing with music lessons. She wanted to leave for Hong Kong as   
soon as possible, but her parents objected because she had no rela-   
tives there. Finally, at her insistence, they permitted her to work out   
an arrangement by which a friend of hers from Peking, already in   
Hong Kong, posed as her fiance, and sent her letters and telegrams   
urging her to join him there. These Grace took to the local officials   
when she applied for her exit permit. The ruse was so thoroughly   
carried out that even her brother and the family servants believed   
she was to be married, and her mother went so far as to go through   
the motions of preparing a trousseau. At first Grace encountered   
some resistance from the officials in her attempts to get the permit,   
but she wore them down with her usual histrionic persistence.   
  
I went to the police station often — sometimes twice a day. ... I   
showed the letters. ... At first I was afraid, as the application was   
turned down. I know that when they investigated at my school, they   
were told to detain me because musicians might be needed later on. . . .   
They asked me why my fianc^ didn't return to be married. Finally I   
went to them with a letter saying he was very sick. I told them I would   
kill myself if he died. I cried and cried. . . . After I had gone to the   
police station forty times, they gave in. . . . They gave me a one-way   
visa. They told me that once people go out, they never come back.   
  
In Hong Kong Grace was not only still reverberating from these   
experiences — she also encountered new difficulties. Although she   
received a great deal of help from a minister to whom she had been   
referred by family friends, her legal status was uncertain and she   
had no regular means of financial support. She reacted to her   
problems with British immigration officials (they even advised her   
to wait in Macao until things were cleared up) with nervousness,   
headaches, palpitations, and diarrhea ("the old feeling returns").   
And she stated (referring partly to our interview situation)   
that she felt as isolated in Hong Kong as she had on the mainland.   
  
I used to feel lonely in Peking and that feeling still lingers on. Certain   
people are sympathetic about this or that, but not about everything. No   
one can really understand all. I can't tell them every trouble. I am still a   
  
35° THOUGHT REFORM   
  
stranger. . . . When people are nice to me it is because they know I am   
out of luck — not because they take me as a friend.   
  
She also found much to criticize in Hong Kong, The atmosphere   
reminded her of a treaty port in China — just the sort of thing she    
had always disapproved of. She was especially uneasy about the im-   
morality — commercial and sexual — of musicians.   
  
Things are different in a colony. I have found people who were respected   

----------------------- Page 298-----------------------

on the mainland, but here they have changed. There's one vocal pro-   
fessor . . . who has a reputation for going out with women students. He   
told me he kept the tuition high so that those who could not pay would   
not come to see him. He said he cares only to make more money. People   
who come here seem to change entirely. All standards of morals are   
different here.   
  
These feelings about Hong Kong, along with her other conflicts,   
led her to wonder whether the Communists might not have been,   
after all, on the right path.   
  
When you are young and trying to find an answer, you wonder, "Am I   
wrong and are they right?" You are still on the point of trying to build   
something for yourself. . . . Should an individualist work with others   
or stay apart? The Communist theory is to work for the mob, the ordi-   
nary people. . . . They can give them what they need. If conditions get   
better they'll make things better for the ordinary people. ... I am   
trying to see both sides. Maybe people have more trouble in a free sys-   
tem. Maybe it is easier in the Communist system. ... I am sure I am   
doing the right thing. I couldn't fit in so I got out. ... I gave up. But   
I am wondering about all of the others who are still there. . . . When   
you think of things like that you just can't get an answer. Too much is   
involved.   
  
Her troubles in Hong Kong continued. She felt that as a   
northerner, she was discriminated against by the Cantonese who   
made up the bulk of the Chinese population. She sometimes   
wondered if a stranger standing near the house where she lived   
was a Communist agent sent to spy on her. And in addition, an old   
fear of the spirit world entered into her immediate living arrange-   
ments. She and others who lived in her boarding house began to   
hear strange sounds at night, including the sound of snoring, which   
seemed to come from the garden outside. One girl reported that   
she had seen the offending ghost, and Grace, along with most of   
  
GRACE WU: MUSIC AND REFORM 351   
  
the others, decided to move from that house. She explained her   
point of view with unintentional humor:   
  
In China, if you are born of a nature called "the killing nature," you   
cannot hear a ghost. My roommate was of this nature. She had been to a   
fortune teller who told her this. ... A person of this nature is harmful   
to his family. . . . And she had not married for fear something would   
happen to her husband or her family. . . . She seemed to have some-   
thing go wrong with every man she met. ... I do not possess the kill-   
ing nature. ... I was told this by a fortune teller whom I went to   
with my mother in Tientsin. ... So it is possible for me to hear a   
ghost, although I have never seen one. ... It is a sign of bad luck to   
hear or see a ghost. ... If one appears, harm will come to the family.   
. . . The landlady and the minister say that we are Christians and   
should not believe in ghosts. ... I do not believe in ghosts because I   

----------------------- Page 299-----------------------

am a Christian, but I cannot help it if I hear them.   
  
For a while she could not even find relief in her music, in the   
past her means of "forgetting everything." She had great difficulty   
in locating a piano for regular practice; and even after she did, her   
anxiety interfered with her musical expression: "I couldn't control   
my hands. ... I couldn't get hold of them."   
  
During the latter stages of our work together, Grace expressed   
some of her broad emotional conflicts in her descriptions of her   
dreams, and in her associations to these dreams. The first dream was   
related to her general fears, to family conflicts and to her residual   
doubts about having left the mainland and come to Hong Kong.   
  
I dreamed that I was back on the mainland with my family. I talked   
again to my father. I was scared. I couldn't tell him what happened.   
Then I got afraid. I couldn't get an exit visa out again this time. I don't   
know whether I went to help the family or not. I woke up upset. I didn't   
know what the dream meant.   
  
In her associations to this dream, Grace expressed her appre-   
hension about her situation in Hong Kong: "Sometimes I think the   
Communists will come here. ... I cannot feel secure." She went   
on to speak at length of her feelings of helplessness and guilt at   
being unable to arrange for her parents and for a close girl friend   
to join her in Hong Kong.   
  
Concerning her parents, there was no clear need for her to do   
anything, but she was troubled all the same.   
  
352 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
My parents would like to come here, but it would be hard for my father   
to start all over in Hong Kong. ... I feel very uneasy. I received a   
letter from them saying I shouldn't write much until I'm settled and   
have more time. ... I feel duty towards them . . . not because I owe   
them anything . . . but I thought I could help.   
  
Her feelings about her girl friend were equally strong, and en-   
meshed in more complicated external arrangements. Grace had been   
trying to set up a scheme to get her out of China similar to the one   
through which she herself had come to Hong Kong, involving a   
young man's writing romantic letters from Hong Kong to her   
friend in China. The contrived correspondence seemed to be work-   
ing well until Grace and the correspondent in Hong Kong came into   
conflict.   
  
At first I wrote the letters and he copied them. She sent the answers to   
him. ... At first he promised to do what I said. He thought it was   
romantic and exciting. I thought it was business. Then he felt he was   
being pushed by me. He wanted to be on his own or else quit. I said he   
could not write love letters himself, as he wouldn't know how to word it   

----------------------- Page 300-----------------------

for the Communists. He wrote a letter to her saying that I was unreason-   
able and he had had enough of me and would do things by himself. . . .   
She wrote me that something was wrong. I told her to drop the corre-   
spondence. ... I had an argument with the boy and he said to me,   
"You came out cold-hearted and half-dead. I am still human." Maybe   
people think that Communism does this to people. ... I have become   
more calculating, but this does me good. Sooner or later one must be   
practical. But people here say it comes to me too early.   
  
These two themes — her guilty involvement with her girl friend,   
and her anxiety over her own conflict with the boy — were brought   
out in her further associations. She and the girl had been room-   
mates at college, and Grace had advised her about many problems   
and had influenced her regarding her approach to the Communists.   
She felt responsible for the girl, and was distressed that her argu-   
ment with this boy had brought about an end to the attempted   
arrangements. It also came out that part of the difficulty was Grace's   
"disgust" toward the boy when he began to make romantic over-   
tures toward her as well as to her friend in China.   
  
Her second dream was primarily a plea for help, partly directed   
at me; but at the same time it was also an attempt at reconstructing   
her life and her sense of self:   
  
GRACE WU: MUSIC AND REFORM 353   
  
Last night I dreamed I met a pianist from my home town. She had al-   
ways been a great success, and had studied in the States with Schnabel.   
... So last night I dreamed of her. ... I met her on the train and   
was so glad to see her. . . I asked her many things but I don't remem-   
ber what she said. I was asking from a musical point of view. Shall I   
take other work than music if I am offered it? Should I try to get a   
piano? Should I go to a teacher? ... I even asked her what books I   
should read. . . . But 1 don't remember what she told me. . . . It's   
funny I didn't get any answers from her.   
  
As she talked more about this dream, it became evident that both   
the girl and the girl's father had played a very important inspira-   
tional role in Grace's past.   
  
She is twelve or thirteen years older than I am. When I was very young   
I was influenced by her. I knew everything she played by heart. ... I   
called her Elder Sister. . . . After I left college and returned home, I   
went to see her father and he gave me books and advice in literature and   
history. He said to me, "You must read as well as play." He talked to my   
parents to help them understand.   
  
She went on to talk of her immediate life situation, and con-   
trasted its tenuousness with the more secure sense of personal   
growth during her earlier days: "Now if the weather is cold, I am   
cold. ... I feel almost transparent, so tiny, so little, that I don't   
exist." Yet she still expressed affirmation in her expectation of a   

----------------------- Page 301-----------------------

solution from within: "I must get answers from myself, though it   
takes a long time."   
  
Although she valued her new freedom to engage in such a search,   
she felt that her past had not prepared her for this self-concern.   
She expressed this in relationship to our interviews.   
  
I have found it difficult to talk to you. It is nothing personal, just that I   
have never before had the chance to express myself. All of these years I   
was told not to think of myself or my own ideas — and it faded out. Now   
I don't feel embarrassed. I feel better to talk and to reach scientific con-   
clusions.   
  
She compared her suppressed personal past to the demands of   
the Communist regime.   
  
Under the Communists, because of the outside pressure, you think less   
about yourself. ... I tried to think less of myself because it becomes   
  
354 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
too complicated if you don't. ... It becomes a habit not to think too   
much about your own feelings.   
  
She vividly described the pleasure and pain of her new self-   
expression.   
  
It was like being shut in a tight room and suffocated. Then you are   
thrown open into a desert. You can have free air but it has its disad-   
vantages. . . . Thinking brings more confusion. In China it is simple   
just being against things. But when you come to the real world, you find    
everything is not like that. . . . Freedom makes things more compli-   
cated.   
  
During the six months in which I knew Grace in Hong Kong,   
she periodically lapsed into psychosomatic illness, usually diarrhea.   
After such bouts, she appeared to be more calm and composed.   
Once, following a week of bed rest, she expressed to me both the   
type of guilty conflict which contributed so much to her illnesses,   
and the secondary gain — that is, the satisfying respite — which the   
illness provided.   
  
I keep thinking, am I asking or wanting too much for myself, and is this   
what makes me feel so bad? . . . When I was young I always expected   
too much — so now I expect the worst. ... I am glad I got sick. I had   
time, and didn't have to rush.   
  
She wondered how much any residual effects of thought reform   
might be contributing to her problems; at the same time she   
thought she had survived and gone beyond thought reform.   
  
The more I tried to explain all of these things, the more complicated it   

----------------------- Page 302-----------------------

gets. ... I feel a person is hurt by a Communist education. But we   
have a saying in China that a lotus is grown from the mud, yet is still   
pure.   
  
She recognized, however, that elements of reform were still with   
her, and that at times she could not avoid judging herself by Com-   
munist standards.   
  
Sometimes I feel subconscious influences from the Communists. If I   
make a decision I think that I shouldn't go through with it because they   
would disagree. ... Or I think back and feel that one or two of their   
theories are right.   
  
GRACE WU: MUSIC AND REFORM 355   
  
But despite this stormy course, her adjustment in Hong Kong   
gradually improved. She was greatly helped by an older woman   
she met through friends ("a mother more or less") who began to   
take a great personal interest in her, accepted her as one of her   
own family, encouraged her to play the piano at her home, and   
also served as an understanding confidante. First she helped Grace   
find young pupils as a means of support, and then helped her make   
arrangements to continue her musical studies in Europe.   
  
Three themes dominate Grace Wu's life story, from early child-   
hood through thought reform and her Hong Kong experiences:   
her Westernization, her musicianship, and her illnesses.   
  
She encountered Westernizing influences far stronger than those   
met by George Chen. Her treaty port background, her father's oc-   
cupation, and her mother's staunch Christianity all placed the family   
in a special Chinese subculture, removed from a good deal of Chi-   
nese life. This subculture had its particular heritage of identity   
strengths and weaknesses. Its strengths lay in its sense of being mod-   
ern and progressive, and in its relationship to Christian ideological   
supports; its weaknesses in its partial severance from Chinese roots,   
in the often shallow, imported middle-class ethos (the Communists   
did not entirely make this up) which Grace herself condemned,   
and in the intensified susceptibilities to guilt created by the super-   
imposed Christian conscience. It is true that when under great   
duress, Grace reverted to pre-Christian ghosts (and it was her   
Christian mother who took her to the fortune teller); but her sense   
of being the Westernized Christian girl was nonetheless very basic   
to her character.   
  
Grace became the dedicated musician early in life. This also was   
an identity closely tied to her relationship with her mother, but it   
was a good deal more. Rather than developing generalized artistic   
sensibilities, as George Chen did, she possessed a focused talent   
which became one of the main centers of her existence. To be a   
dedicated musician meant, for her, to have a form of self-expression   
which could not be denied, a refuge from emotional blows, and a   

----------------------- Page 303-----------------------

sense of being a unique human being. This kind of identity can   
survive almost anything, even if it must be temporarily modified or   
subdued.   
  
Closely associated with Grace's musicianship, however, were   
  
356 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
feelings of evil, of selfishness, of hating and being hateful — all of   
which went into her negative identity. To be sure, these feelings   
must have originated in Grace's early sense of being emotionally   
deprived and frustrated. But they were also related to her quest for   
artistic expression — to the artist's need to ignore ordinary ameni-   
ties of life and to selfishly insist on the opportunity to develop   
talent, even at the expense of others' sacrifices. Her negative identity   
was enhanced by her father's deprecation of her musical interest   
(an attitude which was undoubtedly shared by many others around   
her) , and by her awareness that in the difficult family circumstances   
such an interest could be considered something of a luxury.   
  
An outgrowth of her negative identity was her pattern of escape   
from emotional problems through illness. She carried with her —   
always ready for use — the identity of the invalid. The psychological   
sequence involved, first, a sense of being denied her wishes, along   
with an unusually strong need to obtain what she was after; then a   
feeling of anger and frustration; a sense of guilt over both her de-   
mands and her anger; the illness itself; and the combination of   
attention, sympathy, and relief which it afforded her.   
  
Of central importance was the dilemma of a girl endowed with   
unusually strong passions who felt the need to repress and deny   
these passions almost entirely. Hence her "disgust" (a word which   
she used constantly) over sexuality and her use of Christian ideology   
as an aid in the struggle against her passions. As a musician, she   
became aware that she could hardly dispense with strong feelings   
of love and hate, feelings which she could justify in herself only   
as a musician. Her music-versus-Christianity conflict was essen-   
tially an expression of this same inner struggle. It is true, of course,   
that Christianity, and perhaps especially her polite form of Chinese   
Christianity, has long recommended the taming of sexual and of   
hateful impulses; but she could have — had she felt the need —   
just as well found Christian support for her artistic passions in the   
music of Bach or the paintings of El Greco.   
  
Her adolescent identity crisis therefore took the form of illness.   
With the intensification of passions characteristic for that stage of   
life, her problem became not only what to be — how much the   
musician, the journalist, the Christian, the Chinese, and the woman   
— but what she could safely permit herself to feel.   
  
Taking a journalism course was submission to her parents; at   
  

----------------------- Page 304-----------------------

GRACE WU: MUSIC AND REFORM 357   
  
the same time, her emergence as the "progressive" journalist allowed   
an alternative form of self-expression, one by which she could   
avoid the emotional conflicts which surrounded her music. This   
identity compromise, however, could not work: not only was music   
too basic a part of her to be long denied, but, as it turned out,   
being a journalist in Communist China involved her in a new set   
of passions (or rather, an arduous reshaping of the old ones). Re-   
turning to the identity of the dedicated artist could not protect   
her from these passions, but it could at least permit her to meet   
them with her strongest weapons.   
  
Grace's constellation of identities gave her encounter with thought   
reform an unusual emotional coloring. As a Westernized Christian   
girl, she was immediately identified (and not entirely inaccurately)   
as one of the opposition. Studying in a missionary-established   
"castle of reaction," she was in this respect by no means alone. But   
she was particularly vulnerable because of her close relationship   
with an American teacher — an artist-disciple bond, in which, pro-   
tected by barriers of culture and status, she could experience a form   
of love. This does not however account for the extreme emotional   
pain she suffered during thought reform; her inner stress was greater   
than any of my other Chinese subjects, with the possible exception   
of Hu. The explanation lies partly in her long-standing attitude   
toward any form of strong emotion: suddenly confronted with mass   
frenzy, with the exaggerated passions unleashed by the Com-   
munists, it is not surprising that she became terrified. And when   
she was urged to join in with these passions, to denounce her   
revered teacher, she was overwhelmed by fear and by guilt — guilt   
both over refusing and thereby resisting the authorities, and over   
tendencies within her to comply and make the denunciation. Simi-   
larly, the denunciation of her university president by his daughter   
revived her own complicated feelings of guilt and resentment to-   
ward her parents. The hateful emotions so central to thought re-   
form were precisely the kind she had been warding off all her life.   
  
These emotional patterns led her to distort sexual matters. It is   
true that in the Communist environment politics came first and   
love often was mechanical; but other students reported an atmos-   
phere more puritanical than the uninhibited one Grace described.   
As can occur in any moment of crisis, Grace's fears about sex and   
hostility became confused. Thus, all of her anxieties came to a head   
  
358 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
in her response to the germ warfare inoculation, and she experienced   
the injection as an assault upon her entire person. In making her   
exit from thought reform through illness, she brought a tremendous   
histrionic force to the old identity of the invalid, which was also in   
keeping with her previous use of hysterical mechanisms. Grace's   
negative identity was therefore an important factor in both her pain   

----------------------- Page 305-----------------------

and her escape.   
  
It would be wrong, however, to stress only this side of her char-   
acter. In her resistance to thought reform, she also gave evidence of   
the surprising strength inherent in her sense of being the Western   
Christian girl and the dedicated musician. Her previous exposure to   
Western liberalism and her absorption with Western classical   
music supported her in her belief that "the world could not be like   
this" (or at least that it need not be like this). These two identities,   
and perhaps especially the one of the dedicated artist, gave Grace   
extraordinary staying power. Not only did they help her survive   
thought reform pressures, they also served as important sources of   
stability during her tribulations in Hong Kong.   
  
There she had to face — at first in lonely isolation — both the con-   
fusing aftereffects of thought reform, and an external environment   
which was unusually provocative for someone like her. So great was   
her identity diffusion that she reverted to every pattern of self-   
destructive emotional behavior, and every level of sexual and family   
conflict she had known since early childhood, to the point where   
she felt her sense of existence almost entirely fading away. Yet on   
her own emotional terms her movement toward renewal of identity   
was active from the first. In her dreams, in her relationships in   
Hong Kong, and in her attitudes toward me, she was searching for   
help, but she insisted on being the arbiter of her own life. Among   
my Chinese subjects, she was unusual in her ability to face and to   
talk about both the difficulties of freedom and the extent of residual   
Communist influences. Her return to a mildly Christian, firmly   
Westernized, and profoundly artistic way of life (as well as extreme   
good fortune) led her to her new "mother," and to the promise of   
a creative personal future. Her old emotional patterns were of course   
still very much with her, as was also some of the message of thought   
reform; but equipped with a newly-integrated adult self and a clear   
sense of direction, she would probably manage to live with them.   
  
CHAPTER   
  
CULTURAL PERSPECTIVES:   
  
THE FATE OF FILIAL PIETY   
  
Each of the four Chinese subjects I have described   
experienced first an immersion into thought re-   
form — the beginnings of a personal change — and then a recoil from   
its demands. What brought about this recoil, which contrasted   
with the continued enthusiasms of more successfully reformed Chi-   
nese intellectuals? Without a comparative study of the latter group,   
no certain answer can be given to this question. But from the evi-   
dence at hand, we can say that some features of personal character   
and identity were consistently important in resistance to thought   
reform, not only for these four people, but for the remainder of my   
subjects as well. These are: tendencies toward rebelliousness and   

----------------------- Page 306-----------------------

fear of domination (especially marked in Hu); strong need for in-   
dividual self-expression (George Chen and Grace Wu); binding   
family ties (George Chen); previous patterns of anomie and of   
emotional escape (Robert Chao, Grace Wu, and Hu); and a   
significant degree of Westernization, whether Christian or other-   
wise (Robert Chao, Grace Wu, and George Chen). These tend-   
encies are not simply rallying points of resistance; the conflicts exist-   
ing around them can also create specific susceptibilities to thought   
reform.   
  
Even more important, these are themes which have long been at   
  
359   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
  
  
the very center of the personal struggles of most Chinese intel-   
lectuals. Tension about rebelliousness, self-expression, family loy-   
alties, alienation, and Westernization have particular significance   
for Chinese at this point in their history — as they must for the   
intellectual vanguard of any society whose traditional patterns are   
being replaced. In other words, these four case histories have intro-   
duced a set of conflicts relating to identity and ideology which no   
Chinese intellectual, in facing thought reform, could really avoid.   
  
The roots of such tensions lie in the interplay of individual emo-   
tions with cultural and historical influences. I have chosen, as the   
title of this chapter suggests, to group all of these psychological   
factors around the concept of filial piety, a basic theme of Chinese   
culture, and one which has specific bearing upon the tensions just   
enumerated. And the historical vicissitudes of filialism, or rather of   
Chinese intellectuals (or literati) in relation to filialism, have spe-   
cial psychological importance for thought reform itself.   
  
The individual lives we have been studying in many ways mir-   
ror the history of China itself: early years of filial identities derived   
from traditional Chinese culture; attraction during adolescence and   
young adulthood to more modern and Western influences; and   
finally, a third phase of Communism or thought reform. It seems   
that each Chinese intellectual has had to recapitulate personally   
the larger experiences of his culture in a psychocultural counterpart   
of the biological tenet that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.   
  
Filial influences are part of the entire history of China's tradi-   
tional culture, going back to the Han dynasty (206 B.c-220 a.d.)   
and before, and extending through the Ch'ing Dynasty ( 1644 a.d.-   
1911 a.d.) to the revolution of 1911. "Modern" (I am using the   
term in a more restrictive sense than the way it is employed by   
historians) Chinese identities emerged during a transitional period   
which can be roughly located in the first half of the twentieth cen-   

----------------------- Page 307-----------------------

tury, although it had its beginnings about fifty years before that.   
The third phase, of course, began with the Communist takeover   
of 1948-49.   
  
For each of these historical stages a distinct pattern of Chinese   
cultural identity, based on shared individual experiences, can be   
delineated. To be sure, we must discuss ideal types, in some ways   
over-simplified, and by no means completely inclusive. But these   
can enable us to place both thought reform and the people under-   
  
THE FATE OF FILIAL PIETY 36 1   
  
going it in a perspective which, for being historical, is all the more   
psychological. 1   
  
Traditional Filialism and the Filial Son   
  
In traditional Chinese culture (I refer here most specifically to   
the period of the Ch'ing Dynasty), one was expected to be filial if   
nothing else. For the son or daughter of a gentry-literati family, the   
principle of hsiao or filial piety was at the very center of personal,   
family, and social existence. Its mystique was so powerful and so   
pervasive that Fung Yu-lan, a leading contemporary Chinese philos-   
opher, has called it "the ideological basis of traditional [Chinese]   
society." 2   
  
Whether he was seven or seventy, a son's attitude toward his   
parents was expected to be one of reverence, obedience, and loy-   
alty. Nor was this to be a token response, since if it did not stem   
naturally from his inner being, he was not being truly filial. He   
learned how to be a filial son from his parents and his older brothers   
and sisters, through the unconscious transmission of cultural forms   
as well as through their conscious elaboration. And the indoctrina-   
tion began early: when only three or four, a child might be told   
stories (in a culture very fond of storytelling) of the famous   
"Twenty-four Examples of Filial Piety." These included such tales   
as that of the eight-year-old boy who allowed mosquitoes to "feed   
without restraint upon his blood until they were satisfied" in order   
to prevent them from biting his parents; of the seventy-year-old   
man who dressed himself in gaily-colored garments and played like   
a child "in order to amuse his parents"; and the most impressive   
story of all, entitled "On Account Of His Mother He Buried His   
Child," which is worth quoting in full:   
  
During the Han dynasty, Ko Keu, whose family was very poor, had a   
child three years old. Keu's mother usually took some of her food and   
gave to the child. One day he spoke to his wife about it, saying, "We   
are so poor that we cannot even support mother. Moreover, the little   
one shares mother's food. Why not bury this child? We may have an-   
other; but if mother should die, we cannot obtain her again."   
  
His wife did not dare to oppose. Keu, when he had dug a hole more   

----------------------- Page 308-----------------------

than two feet deep, suddenly saw a vase of gold. On the top of the vase   
was an inscription, saying, "Heaven bestows this gold on Ko Keu, the   
dutiful son. The officers shall not seize it, nor shall the people take it." 3   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
The father-son relationship was most important, the ultimate   
model for almost all other relationships in Chinese society. It com-   
bined love and respect and a certain distance, the last created both   
by family ritual and by the limited role which the father played in   
the child's early upbringing. A child was to feel similar emotions to-   
ward his mother, although here the barriers were down a bit and   
there was room for more indulgence; but, as Ko Keu's story sug-   
gests, there was no less responsibility.   
  
The filial principle extended into all important family and social   
ties. Of the "Five Most Important Human Relationships" described   
by Confucius (between Sovereign and Subject, Father and Son,   
Husband and Wife, Elder and Younger Brothers, and Friend and   
Friend) three were within the family, and the other two were based   
upon specific family models.   
  
One of these, the relationship between Sovereign and Subject, has   
special importance for us. It was conceived as an extension of the   
relationship between father and son: "From the way in which one   
serves one's father, one learns how to serve one's sovereign. The   
respect shown to them is the same." 4 At the same time, it differed   
by being a "social or moral" relationship rather than a "natural"   
(or blood) tie. Therefore, one felt respect but not love for one's   
sovereign. This attitude was compared to that between man and   
wife, in which respect and duty were also emphasized more than   
love. The analogy was especially important for the government   
official (the standard career of the literati class), since he was con-   
sidered "married" to the sovereign. He was expected to emulate   
the bride who transfers her loyalties from her family to her husband   
and his family: "Before marriage she was the daughter of her   
parents; after it, she became the wife of her husband"; in becoming   
"married" to the royal family, a man was expected to experience a   
similar "transformation of filial piety into loyalty to the sovereign."   
But here too there was a distinction, for in this transformation "the   
filial son does not cease to be a filial son"; in fact, in his new situa-   
tion, this transformation "is the only way in which he can continue   
to be a filial son." The point is that loyalty to one's sovereign should   
be part of, rather than conflict with, one's sense of being a filial son. 5   
  
There was thus in the filial identity a strong sense of personal   
continuity, continuity between family and society, and in fact in   
the entire life cycle. The male infant was made much of because,

as one of his most important filial duties, he would continue the

family line. From the first stories casually (or not so casually) told   
to him, through a period of childhood and youth devoted largely   
to a. study of the classics (The Book of Filial Piety, The Book of   
Rites, the Confucian Analects, The Great Learning, The Doctrine   
of the Mean, The Spring and Autumn Annals, The Work of   
Mencius), his education was to a great degree an uninterrupted in-   
doctrination for this identity. As his first exercises in reading and   
writing, he began to memorize filial principles long before he could   
understand what they meant. Most of his education was under his   
family's control; sometimes his tutor was directly employed by   
his family, sometimes he was taught in a clan or village school. Ad-   
vanced institutions for the study of Confucianism did exist in large   
cities; but a gentry youth need not attend one of these to pursue his   
studies of the classics in preparation for state examinations, nor did   
these schools appear to provide the opportunity for youthful self-   
expression that we associate with European and American universi-   
ties.   
  
In traditional China, there was no institutionalized youth culture   
or youth rebellion. 8 There was a group of ch'ing-nien jen (young peo-   
ple, or literally, "green-years men") — male youths between sixteen   
and thirty not yet married — who did to some extent associate with   
each other, but not to the extent of developing a collective voice or   
an organized group life. And since marriages took place early —   
bridegrooms were often in their late teens and brides even younger   
— a youth was not likely to remain in this category for long. Even   
more important in preventing youthful rebellion was the ethos that   
youth was to serve age: whether indulged during early childhood,   
strictly disciplined during later childhood, or allowed a modicum of   
personal freedom during his teens, one's importance lay, not in the   
youth he was, but in the man he would become, and mainly in   
relationship to his family and his society. A Chinese youth became   
a man not by casting off his father's influence and control, but   
rather by adapting himself to them, by becoming like him, by   
identifying with him in attitude and belief, as generations before   
had done with their fathers. 7 A recent sociological observer has   
claimed that "for hundreds and thousands of years there was no   
conflict of generations in China." 8 This statement is surely ex-   
travagant, especially since it ignores inner conflict; but it does in-   
  
364 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
dicate the ideal of father-son continuity which held sway in China   
for so long.   
  
To marry and have children of one's own were in themselves filial   
tasks; as Mencius pointed out, "there are three unfilial acts, and   
of these lack of posterity is the greatest." And as a mature man   
and a father himself, the filial son reinforced his filialism by teach-   
ing its principles to others. At the same time his responsibility for   
the care of his own parents increased, and still included the most   
personal form of attention — a responsibility he could never shirk   

----------------------- Page 310-----------------------

no matter where in the empire he served, or how high in the   
bureaucracy he rose. When his parents died, the filial son was   
expected not only to arrange a proper burial, but subsequently to   
"love what they loved" and "revere what they reverenced." Only   
when he himself became an old man was he able to relax into   
a more carefree existence. Then he finally reaped the full benefits   
of filial piety and enjoyed the solicitude of his family, for it was the   
old whose happiness mattered most.   
  
A woman's life cycle, despite her shift from her own to her hus-   
band's family, had similar continuity, since her marital relation-   
ship was but another dimension of filial responsibility. Men, how-   
ever, were the main repositories of the filial mystique: their studies   
and writings perpetuated its classical ideology; their patriarchal   
position made them its more symbolically important practitioners;   
and in a patrilineal society, it was through the male that the filial   
chain was extended.   
  
Ancestor worship was the filial son's spiritual expression. As   
practiced in literati families, it emphasized the personal, rather than   
the supernatural or absolute. The worshiper was to try to recall the   
faces and mannerisms of his departed parents so that "the eyes of   
the son should not forget the looks (of his parents) nor his ears their   
voices; and that he should retain the memory of their aims, likings,   
and wishes." 9 Ancestor worship was a reinforcement of one's sense   
of biological immortality, and the quest for this immortality was   
itself at the root of the filial ideology.   
  
Needless to say, nobody could completely satisfy these filial re-   
quirements. Indeed, the filial son was attracted from time to time   
to trends in Chinese culture specifically antagonistic to filialism.   
In the ideology of Legalism, which prevailed for a brief period dur-   
ing the third century B.C., he found an authoritarian doctrine which   
  
THE FATE OF FILIAL PIETY   
  
advocated loyalty to a centralized warlike state rather than to the   
family, and the use of coercion rather than the moral exhortations   
of filial piety. In Taoism, as old and as basic a Chinese doctrine as   
Confucianism, he found an opposite extreme, a mysticism which   
viewed earthly obligation as transient and unimportant, and which   
offered a call to withdraw from these in body and spirit to find The   
Way. And later, for several centuries after the first century B.C.,   
Buddhism had a similar appeal. Each of these three doctrines made   
contact with (and itself reflected) a special facet of Chinese char-   
acter. Taoism and Buddhism, in particular — although they were   
most widely accepted by the common people — had lasting appeal   
to the gentry as well, satisfying their more passive, imaginative, and   
nonrational impulses.   
  
Even while he clung to his rationalistic Confucianism, the filial   
son was likely to feel deeply attracted to the escape into nothingness   

----------------------- Page 311-----------------------

of Taoist hermits and Buddhist mystics. This attraction is described   
in the great eighteenth-century novel, The Dream of the Red   
Chamber, whose youthful hero, Pao Yu, abandons both an official's   
career and his pregnant bride for a supernatural Buddhist-Taoist   
destiny. Generations of gentry youth have since vicariously experi-   
enced Pao Yu's escape from filial obligation, neglecting Confucian   
volumes for the surreptitious pleasures of The Dream of the Red   
Chamber. But even Pao Yu squares his filial account before his   
departure: he applies himself to his Confucian studies and passes his   
state examinations with distinction, thereby bringing great honor   
upon his family; he impregnates his bride, thereby insuring his   
posterity; and as his last act before disappearing, he seeks out his   
stern father and bows four times before him "in a solemn k'o-t'ou,"   
thereby expressing his symbolic filial submission. 10   
  
Thus the filial son could be both Confucian in his worldly obliga-   
tions and Buddhist and Taoist during inner moments of flight from   
them. Or he might express other forms of antagonism toward the   
filial web — an admiration of outlaw heroes, heavy gambling, or   
opium smoking — all strongly-developed cultural patterns. One   
Western authority, C. P. Fitzgerald, was so impressed with these   
escapist tendencies in Chinese character that he regarded filial piety   
as an essentially compensatory phenomenon: "The Confucian in-   
sistence on filial duty and the strict training of the young would   
seem harsh until it is realized that the Chinese, a people naturally   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
over-kind and indulgent to children, are also averse to discipline." 11   
Yet during the traditional period Confucianism prevailed over all   
rival ideologies, for its stress upon filial piety gave it a biologically-   
based social ethic of great force, an ethic known in all societies, but   
brought to its highest development in China.   
  
Did this ethic allow for maximum personal growth? Could the   
identity of the filial son provide a rewarding sense of existence? Fung   
Yu-lan answers in the affirmative:   
  
It is by becoming a father or a son, a husband or a wife, that an indi-   
vidual enlists himself as a member of society and it is by this enlistment   
that a man differentiates himself from the beasts. In serving his father   
and sovereign, a man has not given up his personality. On the contrary, it   
is only in these services that his personality has its fullest development. 12   
  
Hu Shih, another contemporary Chinese scholar, expresses the   
opposite opinion:   
  
All the much-idealized virtues of filial piety simply could not exist;   
and in those rare cases where they were consciously cultivated, the price   
paid for them was nothing short of intense suppression, resulting in   
mental and physical agony. 18   
  

----------------------- Page 312-----------------------

There is no doubt truth in both views. Filialism offered one a   
firm and respectable self-image; but many outwardly filial sons must   
have experienced profound inner hostilities toward their ostensibly   
revered fathers. And there is no doubt that society feared this hos-   
tility: in rare cases where parents accused their sons of being "un-   
filial," the latter were publicly disgraced, sometimes whipped by a   
magistrate to the point of death. Crimes of parricide were treated   
as desecrations of the most dangerous sort: the culprit was not only   
beheaded and his body mutilated, but his house was razed to the   
ground, his immediate neighbors and teacher were punished, the   
district magistrate deprived of his office and disgraced, and higher   
provincial officials degraded in rank. 14   
  
Clearly then, rebelliousness had to be repressed, which must have   
resulted in a significant amount of unconscious guilt. The prohibi-   
tion and repression of rebelliousness also undoubtedly contributed   
(at least during the Ch'ing Dynasty) to the stagnation within Chi-   
nese society, to individual passivity, to rationalization of the exist-   
ing order, and to impotence rather than action in the face of a   
  
THE FATE OF FILIAL PIETY   
  
declining civilization.   
  
How did Confucian proponents of filialism deal with such grave   
emotional problems? They returned, in true fundamentalist fashion,   
to the classical texts, seeking to sanctify their message on the basis   
of such passages as the following:   
  
The body is that which has been transmitted to us by our parents.   
Dare any one allow himself to be irreverent in the employment of their   
legacy? If a man in his own house and privacy be not grave, he is not   
filial. If in discharging the duties of his office, he be not serious, he is   
not filial. If with friends he be not sincere, he is not filial. If on the field   
of battle he be not brave, he is not filial. If he fail in these five things the   
evil (of disgrace) will reflect on his parents. Dare he be but serious?   
  
The fundamental lesson for all is filial piety. . . . True love is the   
love of this; true propriety is the doing of this; true righteousness is the   
Tightness of this; true sincerity is the being sincere in this; true strength   
is being strong in this. Music springs from conformity to this; punish-   
ments come from violations of this. . . . Set up filial piety, and it will   
fill the space from heaven to earth. Spread it out and it will extend over   
all the ground to the four seas. Hand it down to future ages and it will   
be forever observed. Push it on the eastern sea, the western sea, the   
southern sea, and the northern sea, and it will be everywhere the law of   
men, and their obedience to it will be uniform. 15   
  
Whatever its strains, filialism was the source of the predominant   
identity of traditional China, a basic ideal against which any other   
form of self-image had to be judged. To be regarded as "unfilial"   
was to be placed beyond the pale. The heritage of the filial son was

one of the strongest and most enduring national identities ever   
created.   
  
Transitional Rebellion: The Modern Student   
  
By the second decade of the twentieth century, the world of the   
young Chinese intellectual had drastically changed, especially in his   
relationship to the ideology of filial piety. In fact, he had apparently   
made a complete about face: "The new China must eradicate the   
Confucian rules of obedience which make slaves of men." 16 These   
words, written in 1916, typify the spirit of the "New Tide" or   
"Renaissance Movement" which was then beginning to flourish   
among rebellious avant-garde intellectuals, and especially among the   
young. Rather than being considered "the root of all virtue," filial   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
piety was being denounced as "the source of all evils." To be sure,   
not every young intellectual felt this way; but such was the power   
of this cultural countertrend 17 that all were significantly affected by   
it. As one Chinese commentator observed,   
  
The inner life of the youth of China was thus completely changed, for   
the ancient motto of China was: "Walk slowly behind the elders; revere   
the past," while the motto of China's youth today is "self-expression." 18   
  
During the most active years of this movement (1915-1920),   
matters came to a head for China both in its national history and   
in the life patterns of its young students. China had long been lag-   
ging in its cultural creativity, deficient in social progress, woefully   
behind the West in technology. Although the Ch'ing Dynasty had   
been overthrown in 1911, the revolutionary movement had foun-   
dered; political chaos went hand in hand with social deterioration.   
And young intellectuals were aware of a similar sense of discon-   
tinuity in their own lives. Although traditional forms had already   
lost much of their hold, the emotions lingered on. Parents con-   
tinued to convey to their children in one way or another the filial   
principles upon which moral behavior should be based, even if (as   
was true of Hu) the social structure made it impossible to practice   
these principles. No longer capable of offering a sense of existential   
harmony, the identity of the filial son now seemed archaic and   
intolerably passive. Confucianism had become a rigid and nar-   
row orthodoxy: its voice was still heard, but to young ears it had a   
hollow ring. To Chinese youth, Western ideas and techniques   
seemed much more attractive than did the decaying institutions   
immediately around them. The cohesion and continuity of the   
traditional period disappeared, to be replaced by intellectual shop-   
ping and acute ideological hunger.   
  
There had been important attempts at reform before this, be-   
ginning in the latter part of the nineteenth century. But they   
had usually followed the characteristic Chinese pattern of "finding   

----------------------- Page 314-----------------------

in antiquity the sanction for present-day changes." Faced with over-   
whelming threats from the West, both ideological and technolog-   
ical, reformers had maintained the ethnocentric hope of using   
Western knowledge for practical purposes only, while maintaining   
the more precious Chinese "essence." 19 They had wished to re-   
vitalize, rather than replace, the ideology of filial piety. This was   
  
THE FATE OF FILIAL PIETY   
  
even to some extent true for those early reformers to whom the   
modern student looked for inspiration, among them men still in-   
tellectually active at the time of the New Tide.   
  
K'ang Yu-wei (1858-1937) was one of these early leaders. First   
at the turn of the century and then again during the New Tide   
itself, he bitterly criticized both the practices of traditional Chinese   
families ("They present a harmonious picture from the outside, but   
inside there is an unescapable and overwhelming atmosphere of   
hatred" ) , and the demand for filial piety within them ( "Birds and   
animals care for their young but ask no reward. Real love does not   
ask for recompense"). Yet in his prescription for utopia 20 (Ta-tung   
Shu, The Book of Great Unity) he took Confucius himself as his   
authority, painting the Sage as a misunderstood Messiah. K'ang's   
famous pupil, Liang Chi-chao, went even further in his condemna-   
tion of the old order, and in his acceptance of Western ideas; but   
he returned from a post-World War I trip to Europe disillusioned   
with the West, and looked again to China's past for spiritual values.   
  
In the New Tide, the modern student found something different   
from all that had gone before: a movement which advocated a break   
with tradition that would be both deliberate and decisive, and which   
made a special plea for young people to assume leadership within it.   
"It is the youth who must save this great revolution from the powers   
of the past," wrote Ch'en Tu-hsiu, one of the leading figures of the   
New Tide, in the magazine which he edited appropriately entitled   
The New Youth. The modern student was even given a blueprint   
for the identity change asked of him: the "old youth" — weak, ef-   
feminate, devoid of militancy, seeking only wealth and high posi-   
tion — was to be supplanted by the "new youth" — courageous,   
strong, free of parental domination, idealistic, and patriotic. 21 In   
this national and personal transformation, the "two gentlemen" to   
follow, according to Ch'en, were "Mr. Democracy" and "Mr. Sci-   
ence." Democracy and science were defined specifically in relation-   
ship to the problem at hand: democracy meant release from the   
bondage of Confucian filial piety, the attainment of equality be-   
tween men and women, the opportunity for individual expression;   
science meant opposition to traditional Chinese thought, and its   
replacement by modern Western learning. 22 Here was the dichot-   
omy (relived by Hu and George Chen) between the "irrational   
past" and the "rational future." And in the accompanying literary   
  
37© THOUGHT REFORM   

----------------------- Page 315-----------------------

  
renaissance, the "new youth" were urged to express themselves in   
clear, forceful, conversational language — "in the living language of   
the people" — rather than in the effete and frequently obscure clas-   
sical style. 23   
  
This was precisely the direction in which the modern student   
wished to go. His group identity had come into being with modern   
schools and universities during the late nineteenth and early   
twentieth centuries. The emergence of a Youth Movement gave   
him sudden prominence. The universities and upper middle schools   
offered him a forum for his rebellion, and an identity to challenge   
that of the filial son (as was true for Hu and George Chen). Fre-   
quently feeling persecuted by his family (and sometimes, like Hu,   
suffering at the hands of members of older generations made des-   
perate by the crumbling of the world they had known) the modern   
student plunged eagerly into the new group life. Thus, a celebrated   
and widely-read novel of the thirties, The Family, whose story is   
laid during the time of the New Tide, describes the young hero's   
isolation and misery when among family members: "He was sud-   
denly overwhelmed by a strange feeling of solitude. It was as if all   
the other members of his family were far away, as if they lived in a   
different world. He felt cold, as though he were oppressed by un-   
speakable sorrow and anguish," and contrasts this with his joy and   
trust when working among his friends for the new ideals they shared.   
  
Here he feels that he is not an outsider, not a lonely man. He loves   
the other young men around him; they love him. He understands them;   
they understand him. He can trust them; they can trust him. 2 *   
  
Although these feelings are in many ways very similar to those   
experienced by generations of Westerners as they emancipate them-   
selves from family control, this youth identity was in China a vitally   
important part of the cultural countertrend. The term ch'ing-m'en,   
"youth," which had little significance in the past, took on a new and   
revealing meaning: it came to suggest articulate young advocates   
(including women, and to some extent peasants and laborers,   
rather than only male gentry-literati) of political radicalism and   
social reform: new generations of youth who married later, often   
resisting their parents' marital arrangements for them, and who   
demanded independent lives physically and emotionally separate   
from parental control. 26   
  
THE FATE OF FILIAL PIETY yjl   
  
Almost overnight the modern student seemed to step into an   
identity which allowed him to be active rather than passive, which   
offered him a sense of logic and purpose rather than meaningless   
compliance with tradition, and an opportunity for self-realization   
rather than self-denial. So strong was the reaction against Con-   
fucianism, and so timely the New Tide's appeal, that the Chinese   
student movement during the transitional period achieved a power   

----------------------- Page 316-----------------------

and influence unmatched by any similar movement in the modern   
world. This power was demonstrated in the celebrated "May 4th   
Movement" of 1919, in which student demonstrations sparked an   
effective national protest against the humiliating Versailles Peace   
Treaty; in the "May 30th Movement" of 1925, another mass demon-   
stration against imperialism; and in the continuous student agita-   
tion against the Nationalist Government (in which Hu and Grace   
Wu participated) prior to the Communist takeover. The first of   
these, the 1919 May 4th Movement, was particularly significant as   
a turning point: as one authority put it, "Henceforward, agitation   
by students gave an ever more powerful impetus to the release,   
slow or violent, of the forces of change in China." 29   
  
In simultaneously rebelling against his family and usurping social   
authority, the modern student was being far from filial, and this   
was bound to cause him suffering. Even if he went on to become   
(like Hu) an extreme rebel, an avenger, or a would-be martyr, the   
filial son within him was likely to remain very much alive. After   
thousands of years, it was not to be easily destroyed. In this respect,   
the modem student's inner life resembled the state of his country:   
immobile tradition, petrified into traditionalism, existed side-by-   
side with iconoclastic and totalistic revolutionary urges. Indeed, the   
psychological strength of the filial tradition was attested to by the   
immense energies necessary to attack it: that part of the past which   
resides within oneself is most difficult to sweep away.   
  
No one expressed this inner dilemma more powerfully than Lu   
Hsun, the greatest of modern Chinese writers and the leading   
literary spirit of the New Tide Movement. His short story, "The   
Diary of a Madman," which appeared in The New Youth in 1918,   
is one of the most effective condemnations of traditional Chinese   
society ever written. The author speaks through his hero, a mad-   
man-sage, who, in his persecutory fears, evokes a twilight world be-   
tween delusion and reality. The story's theme is the "man-eating"   
  
372 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
nature of traditional Chinese society, a theme which is expressed on   
several simultaneous levels of symbolism. The hero notices the   
threatening faces of the people around him, and from various bits   
of evidence concludes that they are going to kill and eat him.   
Wondering what he has done to cause their enmity, he decides that   
it must result from his earlier rebellion:   
  
Twenty years ago I trampled the daily account book [a derogatory al-   
lusion to the Classics] of Mr. Hoary Tradition under my feet. ... I   
did not think that I could be considered a wicked man, but ... I am   
no longer so sure. They seem to think so . . . they have a way of brand-   
ing anyone they don't like as a wicked man.   
  
In a further quest for understanding, he studies ancient history.   
He finds that despite the high moral claims ("over every page was   

----------------------- Page 317-----------------------

scrawled the words 'Benevolence and Righteousness'"), in reality   
"the book was nothing but a record of man-eating"; and that "this   
world in which I had moved about for half a lifetime has been for   
over four thousand years a man-eating world." He thinks of can-   
nibalistic practices which actually occurred in Chinese society and   
decides, "Everyone wants to eat others but is afraid of being eaten   
himself, and so everyone looks at everyone else with such profound   
distrust and suspicion." The leader of the man-eaters around him,   
he discovers, is none other than his older brother (the father's   
representative in the family, and here a symbol of family authority);   
he decides to begin with his brother, first in "cursing man-eating   
men," and then in converting them from their evil ways. But his   
pleas ("you must repent . . . change at once . . . you must know   
that the future has no place for man-eating men") are ignored —   
out of wickedness and because of the habit of rationalization.   
"Some felt that it had always been so and that it was as it should   
be, while others knew that it was wrong, but wanted to eat just the   
same."   
  
Only then does he come to a terrible realization that he too is   
among the guilty. He recalls his older brother's having taught him   
an old principle of filial piety: the belief (which really has existed)   
that if a parent is sick, the child should cut off a piece of his own   
flesh, boil it, and feed it to the parent as medicine. Since this   
brother was in charge of the family at the time of his sister's death,   
he decides (with the logic of a madman-sage) that "they ate my   
  
THE FATE OF FILIAL PIETY 373   
  
younger sister"; and since he also partook of the family meals, "it   
is not at all impossible that I had myself eaten a few slices of my   
sister's flesh!" He comes to know "how difficult it is to find a true   
and innocent man." The only hope lies with the young, and the   
story ends: "Maybe there are still some infants that have not yet   
eaten men. Save, save the infants." 27   
  
Commentators have rightly emphasized this story's assault upon   
traditional Chinese society, but they have overlooked something   
else in it which is equally important: the desperate psychological   
plight — the intolerable anger and overwhelming sense of guilt — of   
the man who has chosen the path of rebellion. The story's hero is   
burdened by three great sins: first, having participated in and   
"tasted" the rewards of the "man-eating" society which he now   
condemns; second, defying four thousand years of authority in mak-   
ing this condemnation; and third, harboring within himself such   
explosive hatred.   
  
Through his imaginative use of his hero's psychosis, Lu Hsun   
made contact with the emotions of the Chinese modern student as   
no other creative writer had before or has since. "The Diary of a   
Madman," described as "the overture and finale" of his writings,   
evoked a sensational response. Young intellectuals found "man-   

----------------------- Page 318-----------------------

eating" an apt description of their own attitudes toward their filial   
heritage, and the psychotic's suffering an expression of their own   
pain.   
  
The antitraditional passions of the New Tide Movement — in   
both its political and literary expressions — set the tone for the en-   
tire transitional period. Emotions and ideas which had been smol-   
dering for several previous generations were now forcefully artic-   
ulated on a mass scale, and they continued to be shared and   
reinforced by succeeding generations of modern students until the   
Communist takeover in 1948-49. But the undermining of the gen-   
eral principle of filial piety (which the New Tide accelerated rather   
than initiated), far from satisfying the widespread ideological   
hunger, created an even greater ideological vacuum. Chinese intel-   
lectuals sought a more comprehensive set of beliefs and a more spe-   
cific program of action.   
  
What psychological characteristics did they require of a unifying   
ideology they might embrace? Any such ideology would have to be   
rebellious in tone to encourage full expression of great hostility,   
  
374 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
to offer some relief for feelings of guilt, and to provide a solution   
to the broad crisis in identity which I have described. It would   
have to be a "modern" (and therefore Western) movement, and   
offer a program for economic development as well as some form of   
popular participation in government. It would inevitably call for a   
national resurgence achieved by casting off both Confucianism and   
Western imperialism. Consequently it had to supply some way to   
attack the past and yet feel pride in it, to condemn the West and   
yet use Western ideas to find a solution to Chinese problems. This   
was a big order, and contending ideologies were tortuously examined,   
experienced, and refashioned in a series of desperate attempts to   
find answers to problems which seemed always deepened rather   
than resolved by time.   
  
The modern student (both during and after his student days)   
was confronted by three ideological alternatives, two of them or-   
ganized movements: the Chinese versions of Nationalism, liberal   
democracy, and Communism. Without attempting to trace a full   
history of any of these, we may ask to what extent each was able   
to satisfy the psychological requirements just mentioned.   
  
By Nationalism, I mean the revolutionary movement initiated by   
Sun Yat-sen, and subsequently embodied in Chiang Kai-chelc's   
leadership of the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party. Both Sun and   
Chiang won great personal acclaim; their call for a strong, modern   
Chinese government was supported fervently by modern students   
as well as by much of the rest of the Chinese population. Just after   
Sun's death, which occurred during the period following the May   
30th incident of 1925, Chiang brought the Nationalist movement   

----------------------- Page 319-----------------------

to its greatest momentum and highest point of popularity. The   
"Second Revolution" of 1926-27 was successfully carried out in the   
midst of a wave of popular sentiment, mass demonstrations, and   
boycotts of Japan and the West. The atmosphere was violently anti-   
imperialist, and therefore anti-Western.   
  
Shared angers and shared hopes did at first unite intellectuals   
and peasants. But Nationalism's effectiveness as an ideology vir-   
tually stopped here: it was able to gain the allegiance of modern   
students, but as these students matured into harassed intellectuals   
they could not find within it a sustained program or a set of ideas   
to satisfy their emotional urges and their rational standards. Sun's   
"three people's principles" (Nationalism, People's Rights or De-   
  
THE FATE OF FILIAL PIETY 375   
  
mocracy, and People's Livelihood) were acceptable enough but   
amorphous, and only the first was convincingly put into action.   
These principles came to be more a catechism recited by school   
children than a set of living beliefs. Nationalism took its forms   
from both Western liberalism and Russian Communism, but in a   
way which was frequently devoid of the inner meaning. It placed   
great stress upon modernization, but at the same time it joined   
forces with the traditionalists in hollow and ritualistic revivals of   
ancient Confucian values. The modern student usually found this   
combination of filial piety and Westernization an incompatible   
ideological admixture, which intensified rather than solved his guilt   
and identity problems. Increasingly, the intellectual drew a sharp   
line between himself and the bureaucrats, financiers, and mili-   
tary men of the Nationalist regime, and looked elsewhere for his   
ideological nourishment. Nationalism was indispensable to him, but   
he found in it no more than half an ideology.   
  
The failure of liberal democracy is a much more complex story.   
By liberal democracy I mean that loose tradition developed in Eu-   
rope and America which advocated social reform, parliamentary   
government, and full expression of individual rights. It would be   
too facile to state categorically, with retrospective wisdom, the   
reasons why it could not have succeeded, although it did face   
extraordinary problems in meeting existing emotional demands.   
Its achievements in China were in fact considerable. It supplied the   
original inspiration for China's trend toward Westernization dur-   
ing and before the transitional period, and was the model for indi-   
vidual expression which lay behind the attack on filial piety.   
  
Ch'en Tu-hsiu's ringing declarations inaugurating the New Tide   
movement, for instance, were inspired by the Manchester liberalist-   
like philosophy which he then espoused, 28 although he later shifted   
his position and became one of the founders of the Chinese Com-   
munist Party (and still later was deposed as one of its first villains) .   
Hu Shih, also a leading spirit in the New Tide, remained one of   
the most articulate spokesmen for liberal democracy throughout the   

----------------------- Page 320-----------------------

transitional period. A disciple of John Dewey, he sought in the   
Chinese past a basis for the pragmatic, scientific approach of his   
teacher; and he accompanied the American philosopher on his   
celebrated and highly influential lecture tour of China in 1919-20.   
And Lu Hsun, although deified by the Communists and certainly   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
a militant leftist, held fast to the liberal principles of "the right to   
life, the right to food and shelter, and the right to the unlimited   
development of the individual." 29   
  
Spread by missionaries, by Western and Chinese educators, and   
by Chinese students returning from the West, liberalism had tre-   
mendous appeal for the Chinese intellectual. But it could never   
satisfy his need for totalism, and its "drop-by-drop" moderation   
(in Dewey's phrase) seemed weak in contrast with the messianic   
tone of its ideological competitors. Liberalism was least able to   
make sustained use of feelings of hostility and rebellion, and al-   
though its stress upon individualism inspired Chinese to challenge   
family authority, it offered little help for the resulting guilt and   
identity stress. It offered no lasting group identity to a people who   
had become dependent upon one, and no substitute for the filial   
loyalties being cast off. In addition, because of its Western origins,   
it bore the stigma of Western imperialism, no matter how strongly   
Chinese and Western liberals opposed to imperialism sought to dis-   
sociate themselves from this stigma. Liberalism also created a   
problem about "Chineseness" (as, for example, for Robert Chao   
and Grace Wu), since the individual Westernization which was   
likely to accompany any profound acceptance of liberal democratic   
ideas often led to a sense of being severed from Chinese roots.   
  
Without entering further into the question of potential com-   
patibility between traditional Confucian humanism and modern   
liberal democratic ideals (and a case can be made for such com-   
patibility), we can say that no effective political-ideological form   
was evolved to unite them. Liberal democratic ideology during the   
transitional period therefore proved more effective in stimulating   
opposition to the past than in resolving pressing emotional con-   
flicts of the present.   
  
Every Chinese intellectual to whom I spoke emphasized just how   
pressing these conflicts were. Even taking into account the general   
tendency during any such transitional period to stress only chaos   
(some intellectuals must have lived relatively stable lives), there is   
no doubt that emotional chaos was widespread. Generations of   
young students had their patriotic emotions aroused but unsatisfied,   
their rebellious feelings frustrated, their guilt unresolved, their self-   
definition obscured. Sons and daughters clashed openly with their   
parents in a society ill-equipped to deal with such strife. While   
  
THE FATE OF FILIAL PIETY 377   

----------------------- Page 321-----------------------

  
great strides were made in youthful self-assertion and in the posi-   
tion of women, much remained confused. In father-son conflicts,   
compromises were often achieved at the price of great anguish for   
both parties. And the breakdown of clear-cut male and female roles   
often resulted in uncomfortably overt female domination, a recur-   
rent theme in our case histories. 30   
  
Once initiated into the antitraditional, modern Western world,   
the Chinese intellectual could never reverse the psychological forces   
generated within him. The intense conflicts and visions experienced   
during youthful struggles to attain adult identity often remained   
throughout life, and the struggles of the modern student in many   
ways came to characterize the entire transitional period. Sometimes   
the former student activist, as he got older, seemed to slip back into   
a traditional pattern, honor his filial duties, then see his own rebel-   
lions mirrored in those of his son. But no matter how filial or how   
"modern" the Chinese intellectual appeared on the surface, some   
conflict between these two emotional tendencies was bound to be   
taking place underneath. His undigested combination of filialism,   
Nationalism, and Western liberalism was likely to leave him —   
at different times and in different degrees — rebellious, withdrawn,   
disillusioned, despairing. Continuous war and plunder further sapped   
energies and hopes — early revolutionary battles, encounters between   
warlords, Japanese invasions, World War II, and the Communist-   
Nationalist Civil War. Governed during the latter phase of the   
transitional period by a group which had become "conservative   
and antirevolutionary" and out of touch with his own aspirations,   
the modem student shared in the "general bankruptcy of morale" 31   
and turned his gaze toward Communism — if it was not already   
there.   
  
Thought Reform: The Filial Communist   
  
In Communism, his third ideological alternative, the Chinese   
intellectual found a no-nonsense solution for his spiritual predica-   
ment. What role did thought reform play in this solution? Was the   
cure worse than the disease?   
  
The interplay between Chinese intellectuals and Communism   
began, not in 1948, but in 1919, immediately following the Russian   
Revolution. From then on, Communism became linked with   
  
378 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
China's own continuous revolution — emotionally, organizationally,   
and ideologically. Of all Chinese mass movements, Communism   
was most capable of harnessing the powerful emotions released in   
the youth-age cultural reversal; 32 moreover, its revolutionary inspira-   
tion and practical techniques were attractive to Nationalist leaders   
like Sun and Chiang, and its emphasis upon social reform was much   
admired by Westernized Chinese liberals.   

----------------------- Page 322-----------------------

  
Communism's greatest ideological weapon was perhaps the   
"grandiose, starkly melodramatic image of the world" 33 provided   
by the Leninist theory of imperialism, the doctrine which placed on   
the Western nations and their international finance capital vir-   
tually the entire onus for China's (or any other "backward" coun-   
try's) wretched condition. Intellectuals of all shades of political   
opinion found in this theory a focal point for hostilities, a reassuring   
interpretation of a humiliating situation, a way to avoid the pain   
of their own struggles with shame and guilt by centering their ac-   
cusatory emotions upon an outside enemy, and a rationale for re-   
jecting that Western enemy even while borrowing his knowledge    
and methods. This kind of emotional relevance leads to great over-   
simplifications, and Chinese intellectuals magnified the part-truths   
of the Leninist theory into a "scientific" gospel.   
  
Liberals, Nationalists, and even traditionalists espoused this   
theory, but it was really Communist property, an integral part of   
the broader Communist scheme. As the modern student moved   
from the Leninist theory to its surrounding Marxist-Leninist prin-   
ciples, which had great currency even outside the Communist move-   
ment, he found that this hostile critique reinforced his own Chi-   
neseness, so that even when he severely criticized China's past,   
he was able to avoid a sense of being completely alienated from it.   
And the unwavering boldness of Marxist-Leninist and Communist   
attacks on both Chinese tradition and the modem West saved   
him from both the confusing complexities of liberalism, and the   
fluctuating ethics of Kuomintang Nationalism. The three-fold Com-   
munist program was clear enough: break filial bonds, expell the   
harmful Westerner, and follow the Communist Party on the path   
to total redemption. Thus the modem intellectual could begin to   
see a possible solution for his long-standing emotional torment;   
not only could hostility be expressed and guilt atoned for, but   
there seemed to be the promise of an identity which was both new   
  
THE FATE OF FILIAL PIETY 379   
  
and Chinese.   
  
Yet at first, for most intellectuals, all of this was no more than a   
possibility, and here is where thought reform enters the picture. In   
the mid-1930's intellectuals recruited to the Communist-held border   
area — just a handful from among the great numbers who were em -   
bracing Communism — were already undergoing a kind of re-educa-   
tion which closely resembled later thought reform programs. From   
that time on, thought reform took shape as the Communists' con-   
veyer of a new Chinese identity. It won adherents, trained cadres,   
ensured compliance to Communist doctrines, and instilled inner   
warning signals of anxiety to guard against potential deviation. Yet   
transcending all of these very important functions was (and is)   
thought reform's role in directing the human aspect of China's vast   
culture change — or to put it more accurately, in redirecting on its   

----------------------- Page 323-----------------------

own terms a culture change which was already well under way.   
  
To influence this change, thought reform had to deal with the   
problem of filial piety, less with its traditional ideology than with   
its modern emotional remnants. This involved thought reform in   
four basic identity tasks.   
  
First and most obvious was the problem of coming to grips with   
filial emotions which have a way of outlasting even the most ex-   
treme kind of transitional rebellion. Emotions of loyalty, self-   
discipline, and respect for authority remained alive side-by-side with   
their negation, and these were emotional commodities too valuable   
for the Communists to waste, even if it were possible to dispel them.   
"Hate your past to win your future," the reformers urged, and they   
meant it. But they might well have added, "Do not hate it so much   
that you cannot bring us its sense of filial dedication." The re-   
formed intellectual was expected to be, as before, loyal, self-dis-   
ciplined, and obedient — now a filial son of the Communist regime.   
  
Thought reform placed equal stress on its second task, the un-   
dermining of lingering effects of Western liberalism. Liberalism was   
a dangerous rival; it still appealed to many intellectuals as an inner   
alternative to Communist discipline. In personal terms, this task   
meant that an intellectual had to be taught to stigmatize as evil and   
selfish those aspects of himself which desired moderation, wished to   
live and let live, considered both sides of any question, or favored   
any form of gradualism. Hu Shih was an obvious choice for the   
symbolic liberal villain. He has been denounced in almost all   
  
380 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
thought reform curricula, and during 1954 and 1955 a special na-   
tional campaign was conducted during which his personal life and   
his pQlitical, historical, and literary opinions were subjected to a   
Communist-style dissection. Hu was condemned as an "extreme   
liberal," a "pro-American," and "worshiper of America," a purveyor   
of "anti-Marxist pragmatism"; and it was made clear that these   
pernicious influences still exterted considerable influence upon in-   
tellectuals. 34 The liberal identity may not have been as deep-rooted   
as that of the filial son, but its relationship to rival political forces   
make it, in Communist eyes, a more dangerous one.   
  
The third task was a mopping-up operation directed against transi-   
tional chaos and against the psychological patterns which accom-   
panied it. Confusion was to be replaced by certainty, wavering   
speculation by absolute knowing. Under attack were many rela-   
tively indefensible identities — those related to cynical detachment,   
asocial self-seeking, or hollow despair, and those associated with non-   
ideological personal loyalties to questionable political, military, or   
financial leaders. In this area the Communists were able to mobilize   
considerable moral force.   
  

----------------------- Page 324-----------------------

Finally, thought reform has had a synthesizing function, the   
building of a new identity. Resurrected filial emotions, much of the   
identity of the modern student, and a sizable chunk of the inter-   
national Communist were all to be a part of it.   
  
An awareness of these four identity tasks enables us to read be-   
tween the cliches of thought reform, and construct an analysis based   
on the principle of imposed identity change. We then discover   
that its language and its demands, stereotyped as they are, have a   
special set of emotional meanings for Chinese intellectuals. In both   
sequence and content, the thought reform process bears down on the   
historical and cultural conflicts I have enumerated.   
  
The first stage of thought reform (the great togetherness) offers   
a prelude of promise — the sense of effortlessly merging with a   
dedicated group which is basic to any Utopian quest. This stage   
revives the group identity of the modern student, and gives an   
immediate sense of release from the emotional chaos of the transi-   
tional period (the third of the four identity tasks). "Thought   
mobilization" then reminds everyone that inner chaos is not to be   
so easily cleared up, that the infection is deep-seated. As Mao him-   
self explains: "The first method is to give the patients a powerful   
  
THE FATE OF FILIAL PIETY 38 1   
  
stimulus, yell at them, 'You're sick!', so that the patients will have a   
fright and break out in an over-all sweat; then, they can be care-   
fully treated." 85 The intellectual is reminded that he has inner   
conflicts (indeed they are made to seem worse than he thought they   
were); but the accompanying rationale gives him a feeling that   
Communist "doctors" possess both the knowledge of cause and the   
means of cure. The treatment will be difficult, but if he will submit   
himself to it totally and trust in his physicians, he will acquire a new   
self, and be better than ever. The stress upon promise and need, and   
the accusations leveled at the distant and recent past indicate the   
general direction of the treatment. This first stage thus focuses the   
intellectual's full attention on the identity tasks at hand.   
  
Stage two (the closing in of the milieu) brings on the struggle   
phase: the pain which the intellectual must experience in order to   
realize the Utopian promise, the psychological surgery necessary to   
rid him of the disease. The "logical dishonoring" of this stage of   
the re-education process can be understood in terms of the specific   
conflicts of Chinese intellectuals.   
  
For instance, the Chinese intellectual is vulnerable to the ac-   
cusation of "individualism" — the most basic criticism, since in the   
eyes of the Communists it "sums up in one term the ideological   
characteristics of the petty bourgeois class" 36 — on all identity fronts.   
When individualism is defined as "ultra-democratic ideology, tend-   
ency for independent action, excess emphasis upon individual lib-   
erty," 37 it is obviously being directed at the Western liberal in him.   

----------------------- Page 325-----------------------

When it is defined as "individual firstism" to include those who   
"both adulate and pull strings," who believe that "what is mine is   
mine and what is yours is also mine," 38 he can feel its valid applica-   
tion to highly-personalized acquisitive patterns which became so   
prominent during the transitional phase. When individualism is   
described as "placing personal honor, status, and interests above   
other things," 39 the intellectual feels it directed against traditional   
patterns still part of himself — especially against the traditional stress   
on preserving individual dignity and social standing which is in-   
herent in the Chinese concept of "face." 40 And the criticism of   
"individual heroism" applies both to the traditional Chinese ideal   
of the chien-hsia or "knight errant" and to more modern ideals of   
"the hero" brought in from the West. Each of these forms of "in-   
dividualism" is equated with selfishness, hypocrisy, and insincerity;   
  
382 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
each is rendered immoral because it allegedly conflicts with the   
greater group interest.   
  
The Chinese intellectual has similar vulnerabilities to the accusa-   
tion of "subjectivism." When this fault is ascribed to those "who   
simply quote the words of books they have studied as the sole basis   
for the solution of problems," it is being directed at a long-standing   
Confucian pattern which persisted in the approach of Chinese   
intellectuals to Western knowledge as well as to Confucianism   
itself.* 1 When Communist reformers denounce the "subjective   
idealism and mysticism" of such liberal approaches as those of   
John Dewey and Hu Shih, 42 they are dealing with a more recent set   
of hopes and visions so consistently shattered that many Chinese   
intellectuals are now willing to view them as illusory. "Worshipping   
blindly Western culture" 43 is another accusation which makes   
effective contact with the modern student identity in all Chinese   
intellectuals (but since the Communists could themselves be ac-   
cused of doing the same thing, much depended on which aspects   
of Western culture were chosen as objects of worship).   
  
Just as the "sincere man" (one who submits totally to the Com-   
munist movement) is offered as the identity alternative to individ-   
ualism, so the "scientific" practitioner of Marxist-Leninism is the   
alternative to subjectivism: "Marxism-Leninism, derived from ob-   
jective reality and tested by objective reality, is the most correct,    
scientific, and revolutionary truth." 44 This form of scientism (I use   
the term to mean both a false claim of precision based upon an   
alleged natural science model, and a deification of science itself)   
has a very special appeal for those rebelling against a non-West-   
ern, nonscientific cultural tradition. Scientism was thus a comfort-   
able ideological resting place for many Chinese intellectuals after   
the confusing array of ideas to which they had been so recently   
exposed.   
  
The Communists equated most additional criticisms either with   

----------------------- Page 326-----------------------

individualism or with subjectivism, but two of their other epithets   
— "liberalism" and "sentimentalism" — have special importance for   
the problems under discussion.   
  
I have already mentioned the accusation of "extreme liberalism"   
applied to Hu Shih; closely related is the chaTge of "extreme dem-   
ocratic tendencies." Both these accusations have direct application   
to those Western liberal influences which the Communists seek to   
  
THE FATE OF FILIAL PIETY 383   
  
undermine; but there is also a specifically Chinese connotation for   
"liberalism." In an essay devoted to this question, "In Opposition   
to Liberalism," Mao's first illustrative bad example is "failing to   
start an argument in principle with a person, even when you   
know he is in the wrong, letting things slide for the sate of peace   
and cordiality, all because he is an old friend, a fellow villager, a   
fellow student, a close friend, someone beloved, an old colleague, or   
an old subordinate ... or speaking about [the error] in allusions   
in order to preserve harmony and unity." Mao is referring here   
mainly to the principles of personal loyalty, propriety, and harmony   
carried over from the filial identity of traditional Chinese culture.   
All these principles are then viewed in terms of individual char-   
acter, and "liberalism" is extended to include "refusing to consider   
correction of your errors even when you recognize them, adopting   
a liberal attitude toward yourself." 45 Liberalism becomes equated   
with laxity, softness, and self-indulgence. Here, the traditional   
Chinese considerations for "human feelings" — that special tolerance   
for individual frailty which gave balance to an otherwise rigid   
Confucian system — is under fire; and so is the modern liberal ethic   
which also urges respect for individual differences.   
  
"Sentimentalism" has essentially the same significance as the   
personal side of "liberalism," and refers mainly to a reluctance to   
sacrifice personal loyalties, and especially those of family, to politi-   
cal (Communist) considerations. This is primarily an attack upon   
traditional practices, although a modern liberal can also be guilty of   
sentimentalism in connection with his concern for other people as   
individuals. A deep reluctance to sever his personal ties was often   
more than offset by the Chinese intellectual's rebellion from these   
ties, as well as by his conviction that sentimentalism and nepotism   
had long been barriers to Chinese progress. He was, moreover,   
offered an identity alternative which was just the opposite of liberal   
and sentimental softness: that of a "straightforward, loyal, and posi-   
tive" person who would, "no matter where or when, uphold correct   
principles and struggle untiringly against all incorrect thoughts and   
actions" 46 — in other words, he was to become definite rather than   
wishy-washy, active and "masculine" rather than passive and "femi-   
nine."   
  
The methodical criticisms and self-criticisms of thought reform's   
second stage are thus aimed at breaking down every emotional iden-   

----------------------- Page 327-----------------------

  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
tification which could interfere with the full acceptance of the new   
Communist identity. Authorities from outside the Communist   
camp are devalued (as, for instance, the university professors who   
were publicly humiliated) until they too fall into step with the   
Communist program. Nothing in one's heritage is to remain worthy   
of respect unless it contributes to the "new man" being shaped.   
  
The final stage (submission and rebirth) completes the four   
identity tasks. In this stage the intellectual symbolically acts out   
his "turning over," and at the same time commits himself to it by   
his written analytic statement.   
  
The denunciation of one's father is the symbolic act par excel-   
lence. Through it the intellectual is to cast off his tie to filialism   
entirely; after this let no man regard him as a traditional filial son.   
The act also severs him from his more recent past, and allows him to   
disown the identities derived from the transitional period. It has   
this last effect because in China the father has always been especially   
representative of a man's past, and because the fathers of con-   
temporary intellectuals were very apt to have been associated with   
Nationalist, liberal, or other transitional Western influences (as   
they were for three of my four Chinese subjects). Indeed, the most   
celebrated denunciations of fathers were cases in which the fathers   
had distinguished themselves mostly in connection with Western   
learning: Lu Chih-wei, the former president of Yenching Univer-   
sity, whose humiliation by his daughter was described by Grace   
Wu, was an American-trained psychologist; Liang Chi-ch'iao, who   
was posthumously condemned by his son, himself a university   
professor, was one of the great early reformers; and a widely-pub-   
licized attack was made upon Hu Shih (in absentia) by his son.   
The latter called his father a "public enemy of the people, and an   
enemy of myself" and went on to state the identity issue in very   
clear terms: "I feel it is important to draw a line of demarcation   
between my father and myself." 47 The "line of demarcation" is be-   
tween father and son, old regime and new, family and Party, past   
and future.   
  
The final thought reform summary, with its detailed class analy-   
sis, codifies and conceptualizes the identity shift, and puts it on   
permanent record. The class analysis is based on Communist psy-   
chological theory, the crux of which is that "in a class society, man's   
class character forms the very nature and substance of man . . .   
  
THE FATE OF FILIAL PIETY   
  
the class character of man is determined by his class status." 48   
The thought reform participant can draw upon this concept for a   
correlation of class and character: those from "exploiting classes"   
are extravagant, competitive, cruel, abusive; those of proletarian

origin seek solidarity, mutual co-operation, have a "sense of organ-   
ization and discipline," and are also characterized by "progressive   
outlook and demand of public ownership of property," revolt   
against all exploiters, militancy, tenacity, and so on — in other   
words, the ideals of the Communist Party as an organic representa-   
tive of the working classes. Intellectuals, since they have bourgeois   
and petty bourgeois backgrounds, must inevitably reflect the charac-   
teristics of these classes: idealism, greed, objectivism, individualism,   
and stress on personal honor and status. In this sense, all of thought   
reform is an attempt to emulate Mao Tse-tung's own example and   
"outgrow" one's class characteristics by changing from one class   
to another. If an intellectual cannot achieve this ideal of becoming   
"one with the masses of workers and peasants" 49 he can at least   
do the next best thing and "accept the direction of the ideology   
of the working class" — in other words, of Marxism-Leninism and   
"the thought of Mao Tse-tung." 50 These views on class char-   
acter, derived from earlier Communist writings, have limitations   
as psychological theory, but they do serve as a framework for the   
content of the final thought summary or personal confession. They   
supply the necessary theoretical basis for commitment.   
  
The third stage ends on a note of togetherness very similar to the   
one with which the program begins. The pattern of thought reform   
thus follows the classic Marxist sequence of harmony, struggle,   
harmony; in psychological terms — group identification, isolation and   
conflict, and reintegration. At every moment of thought reform,   
the intellectual has revised, rejected, and modified elements of his   
past in order to dislodge himself from what he was, and become   
someone else.   
  
As painful as it is, thought reform would never have a lasting   
effect if it did not offer a new and appealing sense of identity as   
its reward. I have so far mentioned only a few of the character traits   
which thought reform attempts to instill. In general, the reformed   
identity is based upon principles originally applied to Communist   
party members, the elite of the Communist movement. This identity   
is therefore not an exact blueprint, but rather an ideal which   
  
386 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
neither the dedicated Communist nor the ordinary intellectual can   
hope to realize fully. But like the identity ideal of the filial son,   
it is one against which everything else must be weighed.   
  
Partly for this reason I have called the thought reform identity   
the "filial Communist" — but not for this reason alone. For in be-   
coming a filial Communist, the Chinese intellectual becomes part   
of a new mystique, also vast in its scope and stringent in its de-   
mands, one which, like the old Chinese family system, envelops   
almost his entire life space. The filial Communist draws upon   
traditional sources for its all-important ethic of loyalty, and taps   
the values of the transitional period for its stress upon progress,   

----------------------- Page 329-----------------------

science, and change. It is thus a culmination of the historical   
Chinese identity shifts we have been discussing.   
  
What is the "new man" of thought reform to be like? Many of   
his characteristics were described by Liu Shao-chi in the famous   
pamphlet, "How to be a Good Communist." Liu's criteria, those   
from other Communist writings, and the attitudes expressed by   
my subjects allow us to summarize the personal qualities of the ideal   
filial Communist as follows: he is active, energetic, decisive, un-   
ambivalent, forceful, masculine, unwavering in his thoughts and   
actions; he is logical, scientific, materialistic, and disdainful of   
mysticism, of notions of spiritual values, and of philosophical ideal-   
ism; he is realistic, down to earth, simple in his tastes, deeply re-   
spectful toward labor and toward the masses, critical of artistic   
and intellectual efforts that are not of practical value; he is selfless   
and totally dedicated, subordinating his own interests to those of   
the Party and the People in every conceivable manner, ready to   
make any sacrifices, including that of his life, and to be, in so doing,   
the happiest of men; he is humble, self-critical, receptive to criticism   
from others, eager to improve himself in order to be able to do still   
more for his cause; he is always enthusiastic, confident, high-   
spirited, totally sincere in his manner and in his beliefs, well-   
integrated within himself and in harmony with his society; he is   
modern, progressive, forward-looking, disdainful of traditional cul-   
tures and of requirements dictated by past custom; he is conscious   
of his relationship to a great international movement, of his role   
in liberating human beings from their bondage, and of having   
participated in "the remoulding of the substance of mankind"; yet   
he is proudly Chinese, intensely patriotic, nationalistic, aware of   
  
THE FATE OF FILIAL PIETY 387   
  
being part of an old and great civilization, of a nation far exceeding   
any other in population and in potential power.   
  
While no such man could possibly exist, the identity ideal is   
impressive in its excess of both crassness and nobility. It contains   
in its totalism the psychological potential for wide-ranging accom-   
plishment as well as for bitter disillusionment. No more radical   
change in Chinese character has ever been called for.   
  
Do these identity shifts mean that filial piety, in the original   
family sense, no longer has any emotional appeal for Chinese in-   
tellectuals? We can draw no such conclusion. The history of other   
mass movements teaches us that attacks upon family ties are   
most characteristic of early phases. We can expect in China, as hap-   
pened in Russia, a revival of support for the family — that is, for a   
form of "new Communist family," regarded as an extension of   
rather than a threat to the regime. It is doubtful whether anything   
approaching the old ideology of filialism can ever reappear in   
China, but its central principle of obedience and loyalty of children   
to their parents is too basic an emotional phenomenon, and one too   

----------------------- Page 330-----------------------

deeply rooted in Chinese life, to be long negated. Not only does   
the new Communist man bear the stamp of his filial past; his   
creators — perhaps more than they realize — are influenced by that   
same cultural heritage.   
  
CHAPTER   
  
CULTURAL PERSPECTIVES: ORIGINS   
  
  
  
Where did the Chinese Communists learn their re-   
form skills? How did they get to be such master   
  
psychologists?   
  
These are questions I have frequently been asked, and as often   
as not the questioner has in mind a theory of his own: the Chinese   
have studied Freud on individual psychology, or Kurt Lewin on   
group dynamics, or Pavlov on conditioned reflexes. The first two   
of these theories (Freud and Lewin) are products of a cultural and   
professional ethnocentrism among Western psychiatrists and social   
scientists; actually, neither Freud nor Lewin has had much in-   
fluence in China or Russia. The Pavlovian theory is more generally   
held. It is based on a chain of associations that goes something like   
this: Pavlov — Russian scientist — supported by Soviet regime —   
Soviets use his theory of conditioned reflex for propaganda pur-   
poses — they taught his techniques to the Chinese — result, thought   
reform. But there is no convincing evidence that thought reform de-   
veloped this way. It is true that academic psychology in Communist   
China does follow the Soviet lead in emphasizing Pavlovian theory,   
but academic psychologists apparently have had nothing to do with   
thought reform. And even in the Soviet Union, according to an   
American authority, there has been nothing to indicate that psy-   
chiatrists or psychologists have shaped confession or indoctrination   
techniques, or even that Pavlovian theory has been an important   
  
388   
  
ORIGINS 389   
  
model for propaganda approaches. 1 In all three of these theories   
there is the twentieth-century tendency to single out the scientific   
specialist both as the fountain of all knowledge and the perpe-   
trator of all evil. Moreover, all of them neglect the two great histori-   
cal forces which shaped thought reform: Chinese culture and Rus-   
sian Communism.   
  
The Russian Communist contribution to thought reform is   
immediately apparent in much of the content and many of the   
forms of the process: the allegedly scientific Marxist-Leninist doc-   
trine; the stress upon criticism, self-criticism, and confession as   

----------------------- Page 331-----------------------

features of "ideological struggle"; the organizational techniques of   
"democratic centralism"; the combination of Utopian imagery and   
iron discipline; the demands for purity of belief and absolute obe-   
dience; and the practice of informing upon others in the service of   
the Party. Certainly, many of the pressures used to extract confes-   
sions in penal thought reform closely resemble techniques used by   
the Russians during the great Soviet purge trials of the late 1930's:   
the irresistible demand for an admission of criminal guilt, however   
distorted or false, and the prolonged interrogations, physical pres-   
sures, and incriminating suggestions used to obtain it. 2 Eastern   
European Communist nations have employed similar confession   
methods, for instance, in the widely publicized cases of Cardinal   
Mindszenty, William Oatis, and Robert Vogeler.   
  
Russian Communist influences are also responsible for thought   
reform's immense stress upon sin and evil, and for its continual   
manipulation of feelings of guilt within all who take part in the   
program. Such a focus upon sin and guilt has never been prominent   
in traditional Chinese culture. These Soviet Russian contributions   
are in turn derived from the many cultural influences which fed   
modern Communism: the Judeo-Christian religious tradition, the   
Utopian secular ideologies of the eighteenth century, mystical   
elements of German romanticism, and the authoritarian excesses   
of traditional Russian and Byzantine culture, including the heritage   
of the Russian Orthodox church.   
  
But after acknowledging these Russian and Western debts, we   
must still ask why it was the Chinese who developed thought reform.   
Other Communist countries have, to be sure, used elaborate   
propaganda techniques and various psychological pressures, but   
never with thought reform's meticulous organization, its depth of   
  
39° THOUGHT REFORM   
  
psychological probing, or its national scale. Nowhere else has there   
been such a mass output of energy directed toward changing people.   
In Russia confessions have generally been associated with the purge   
— the "ritual of liquidation"; in China, confession has been the   
vehicle for individual re-education. What is the source of this   
special reform emphasis?   
  
Communist leaders reveal the source in some of their thought re-   
form writings. Liu Shao-chi, for instance, in "How to be a Good   
Communist" enjoins Party neophytes to pursue diligently their   
"self-cultivation." And he quotes as an example the experience and   
the words of none other than Confucius himself:   
  
At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning. At thirty, I stood firm.   
At forty, I had no doubts. At fifty, I knew the decree of Heaven. At   
sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth. At sev-   
enty, I could follow my heart's desire, without transgressing what was   
right.   

----------------------- Page 332-----------------------

  
Liu also makes reference to the Confucian disciple who said: "I   
reflect on myself three times a day," and to the Book of Odes   
which suggests that one cultivate oneself "as a lapidary cuts and   
files, carves and polishes." He refers to the Confucian principles   
expressed in the following quotation from The Great Learning:   
  
The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the   
kingdom first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their   
own states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their   
families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their   
persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts,   
they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere   
in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost, their knowledge.   
. . . from the Son of Heaven down to the mass of the people, all must   
consider the cultivation of the person the root of everything besides. 8   
  
These principles echo in the thought reform program, although   
Liu does of course emphasize the Communists' needs to stress   
materialism rather than classical "idealism," and to achieve their   
self-cultivation not through passive meditation but rather by means   
of active participation in the Communist movement.   
  
Yet the concept of self-cultivation is distinctly Confucian, as is   
Liu's injunction to Communist cadres that each "watch himself   
when alone." Liu and other Communist theorists may refer to these   
  
ORIGINS 391   
  
traditional principles in order to introduce the alien words of Marx,   
Lenin, and Stalin in a familiar idiom; but this Confucian idiom   
does have deep emotional meaning even for anti-Confucian re-   
formers, and it is this lingering Confucian spirit which has caused   
the Chinese Communists to make an ideological fetish of moralistic   
personal re-education.   
  
Similarly, the Confucian principle of "rectification of names"   
(which according to the Sage was the first and most important task   
for a new ruler) has important bearing upon thought reform's ap-   
proach to the reshaping of identity. In both cases, "rectification"   
means changing not the "name" or category of man, but rather   
changing the man himself until he fits that category — the Con-   
fucian or Communist ideology, of course, being the arbiter of   
proper standards. This principle is expressed in Confucius' demand,   
"let the ruler be ruler, the minister be minister; let the father be   
father and the son, son," and in the Communist demand that the   
intellectual be the "progressive" or "proletarian" intellectual or the   
"good Communist." For Confucianism shares with Communism   
the assumption that men can and should remake themselves, first   
as part of a process of changing their environment, and then as a   
means of adapting themselves to their environment. Both systems   
always involve a subtle interplay between role and identity: one first   

----------------------- Page 333-----------------------

learns the more or less formal requirements for thought and be-   
havior, and only much later becomes in his essence the thing aspired   
to. This is called achieving complete "sincerity."   
  
And in Confucianism, just as in thought reform, the ideal of   
sincerity is made almost sacred:   
  
Sincerity is the way of heaven. The attainment of sincerity is the way   
of men. He who possesses sincerity is he who, without an effort, hits   
what is right, and apprehends without the exercise of thought; — he is   
the sage who naturally embodies the right way. He who attains to sin-   
cerity is he who chooses what is good and firmly holds it fast.*   
  
This Confucian (and later neo-Confucian) notion of sincerity   
depends very much upon the principle of harmony: harmony   
within, permitting one to act correctly in an automatic fashion, and   
harmony without, enabling one to find his proper behavior in re-   
lationship to other men. To be sincere, in traditional China, meant   
to possess an inner urge toward fulfilling one's obligations, includ-   
  
392 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
ing both the desire and the means for conforming to the filial   
ideology. Only the sincere man could give full expression to his   
nature, possess genuine self-knowledge, exert a beneficial influence   
upon others, and achieve a complete union (both organic and   
mystical) with Heaven and Earth. Thought reform is a way to   
achieve such sincerity in relationship to Communist doctrine. As in   
Confucianism, it is finding the correct path; as in neo-Confucianism   
it is combining knowledge and action. And the man who is truly   
sincere, like his Confucian and neo-Confucian counterparts, is said   
to possess superhuman powers. 5   
  
These traditional Chinese themes could be expressed in thought   
reform only because they were also consistent with Marxist-Leninist   
principles. And this double fit has enabled the Chinese Communists   
to pursue them so energetically. Marxist-Leninist writings, for in-   
stance, are replete with references to personal reform; a similar   
Chinese cultural tradition has enabled Chinese Communists to be   
good Marxists. Communist practice in any country requires role-   
playing and identity change; but the Chinese bring to this a more   
concrete and explicit — not to say diligent — emphasis. In the matter   
of sincerity, Leninists too stress uniting theory and practice; but   
it is thought reform's combination of Marxist-Leninist (including   
Christian and Russian) with Confucian influences that has pro-   
duced the bizarre extremes described in this book: for when the   
Eastern notion of The Way was combined with the Western ideal   
of credal purity, sincerity came to mean nothing short of absolute   
submission.   
  
It is impossible to document all the ways in which traditional   
Chinese and Russian Communist styles come together in thought   

----------------------- Page 334-----------------------

reform, but a few of the more important convergences are worth   
listing. We have already noted the great sweep of both Confucian-   
ism and Communism; both cover all aspects of human existence   
in their stress upon loyalty and orthodoxy. In addition, both have a   
tradition of benevolent leadership by a small elite, within a strongly   
authoritarian framework. They also share an emphasis upon the   
responsibility of the individual person to the larger human group,   
upon his impotence when he stands alone, and upon the dangers   
of deviant individual initiative. In both there is the conviction that   
human nature is essentially good, although the extent to which   
both seek to control human behavior makes one wonder whether   
  
origins 393   
  
their advocates really believe this. The Russian Communist re-   
liance upon emotionally charged slogans has an analogue in the   
traditional Chinese style of thinking in wholes rather than in parts,   
of using proverbs and metaphor to envelop a subject emotionally   
as well as intellectually. 6 There is some similarity (along with a   
good deal of difference) between the Soviet Communist dualism   
of the dialectic and the traditional Chinese dualism of Yin and   
Yang." 1 The traditional blood brotherhood of Chinese rebel bands   
and secret societies resembles Communism's sense of cloak-and-   
dagger intimacy and moral mission. The Soviet Communist stress   
upon personal confession (the main source of this ethic for thought   
reform) had some relationship to the traditional Chinese practice   
of requiring local officials to accept blame for such things as natural   
catastrophes and to "confess" that their own unworthiness may   
have been responsible. And in the prison setting, Russian Com-   
munist pressures to confess (themselves apparently derived from   
practices of the Tsarist Okhrdna) come together with a traditional   
Chinese custom of requiring a prisoner to confess his crime be-   
fore being judged, while granting the judge considerable latitude   
in the methods he could employ to extract this confession. 8   
  
How did this blending of cultural styles occur? The extensive   
thought reform program which the Communists had ready at the   
moment of the takeover was obviously the product of years of   
preparation. I was fortunate in being able to discuss this question   
in some detail with Mr. Chang Kuo-t'ao, one of the leading figures   
of the early Chinese Communist movement until his defection in   
1938. According to Mr. Chang, the Communists began to employ   
systematic, if crude, reform techniques as early as the late 1920's.   
Communist leaders commanding small and relatively isolated mili-   
tary units began to devote much attention to the problem of win-   
ning over captured enemy soldiers and groups among the general   
population. Their task was complicated by the differences among   
their prospective converts: peasants, opium-smoking bandits, dis-   
gruntled conscripts in the Kuomintang armies, old-time Kuomintang   
supporters, uninvolved bystanders, and idealistic intellectuals. They   
first utilized international Communist principles, learned from   
Soviet contacts, dealing with "agitation and propaganda." But   

----------------------- Page 335-----------------------

very soon they began to modify these and develop their own pro-   
grams derived from their special Chinese environment.   
  
394 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
They approached uneducated peasants on a simple colloquial   
level. Ordinary enemy soldiers were first treated with unexpected   
"leniency"; then they were encouraged to vent all of their grievances   
against such past authorities as landlords and officers (to "vomit   
bitter water"); next they were taught to recognize the social evils   
of the Kuomintang regime as the source of their suffering ("dig   
the bitter roots"). The soldier was then offered an opportunity to   
remain with the Communists — to join the "one heart movement"   
to combat Chiang Kai-shek and create a new China; or he was   
given the option of returning to his home village as a person osten-   
sibly sympathetic to the Communist cause. As in later programs,   
participants quickly became themselves active reformers: peasant   
soldier captives showing signs of "progress" were encouraged to   
circulate among new arrivals with similar class backgrounds, and   
help in the latter's "vomiting" and "root digging" by recounting   
their own happy reform experiences.   
  
With captured officers the Communists employed more sophisti-   
cated and individualized approaches. After separating the officer   
from his men, they would assign to him some of their most articu-   
late and persuasive spokesmen, and then subject him to prolonged   
analytic discussions of his personal relationship to the Chinese   
Civil War. Struggle procedures were used upon the most recal-   
citrant, and those known to be responsible for the death of large   
numbers of Communists were often executed; but there was an   
attempt to win converts whenever possible.   
  
Chang emphasized that, with both officers and men, the Com-   
munists were consciously aware of the importance of setting an   
impressive personal example in their own dedication, discipline,   
and personal morality. After their first more or less experimental   
military efforts, the Communists proceeded in twenty years of   
trial-and-error improvement to make their program increasingly   
efficient. They extended the reform efforts to Japanese prisoners cap-   
tured during the thirties and later to American prisoners captured   
during the Korean war. But their main efforts were concentrated   
upon their own countrymen during the phases of the long Chinese   
Civil War, so that by the time of the takeover, they had learned   
how to apply them quickly and effectively to entire armies of   
prisoners.   
  
The reform program specifically for intellectuals, as opposed to   
  
origins 395   
  
that for military captives, was developed by Communist groups   
operating in the outlying border areas during the Yenan period   

----------------------- Page 336-----------------------

(1935-45). I n order to absorb the large numbers of intellectuals,   
sympathetic but inexperienced (at least in the ways of revolution),   
who made their way to these Communist areas, a number of special   
training centers were set up. Those in the Yenan area of northwest   
China — the Anti-Japanese University, North Shensi Academy, and   
Marx Lenin Institute (later renamed Lu Hsun Academy) — gave   
rise to the thought reform programs for intellectuals we have been   
studying.   
  
Here, as elsewhere, the Communists started with a prescribed   
Russian Communist model: the Yenan institutions were set up as   
replicas of Sun Yat-sen University in Moscow, an early training   
center for Chinese Communist intellectuals. This model was then   
adapted to their own revolutionary style. The Communists im-   
provised as they went along, hardly following a precise scientific   
"methodology." Indeed, Mr. Chang felt that an important factor in   
the introspective hsiieh hsi, or group study process, was the isolation   
of many of these early institutions, and the lack of qualified teachers   
and textbooks, so that much of the subject matter studied had to   
come from the participants. This comment, while far from a full   
explanation, does make clear how important the external circum-   
stances were under which the Chinese Communist revolutionary   
movement synthesized Chinese and Russian Communist themes.   
Nor were Chinese improvisations always approved by Russian ad-   
visors: Chang mentioned that on several occasions Chinese Com-   
munist leaders were criticized for being "too much influenced by   
Confucian ethics." Yet this moral and psychological emphasis   
seemed to come naturally to them; according to Chang, they were   
"good psychiatrists." And although the Nationalists made similar   
efforts to "reform" Communists and Communist sympathizers in   
special "repentance camps," their efforts were (according to Chang   
and many other observers) much more clumsy and much less   
effective.   
  
Perhaps the crucial step in the development of the Communist   
reform program for intellectuals was the Cheng Feng (literally,   
reform of work style or "spirit") conducted within the Communist   
Party, mostly in Yenan, from 1942 to 1944. (Mr. Chang was no   
longer with the Communists then; my information here is based on   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
written studies and on the impressions of my subjects.) During this   
campaign, the basic techniques, as well as the widely-circulated   
Reform Documents from which I have been quoting, were evolved.   
  
At' the time of the Cheng Feng, the Party faced the problem of   
the threat of unorthodoxy among its heterogeneous recruits, and   
especially among its intellectuals; it was also confronted with the   
task of Sinifying a Marxist movement whose ideology had here-   
tofore been entirely foreign, and it had to invigorate intraparty   
morale. 9 It is of the greatest significance that the Chinese Com-   

----------------------- Page 337-----------------------

munists solved these problems through personal confession and   
re-education, that these forms of introspection were used to pro-   
duce within each Party member the desired blend of Leninism and   
Chineseness, along with a sense of personal revitalization. From   
this movement the Chinese Communists' own ideology (mostly   
in the form of "the thought of Mao Tse-tung") emerged; the im-   
portance of this ideology lay not in any brilliant originality, but   
more in its organizational and psychological usefulness, and in the   
renewed sense of group identity to which both the campaign and   
its ideology contributed. After the Cheng Feng, the die was cast;   
just a year later, "the documents of the movement had become    
Party dogma, and the reform process had become a continuing   
organizational mechanism." 10 Even such a brief outline of the his-   
tory of thought reform confirms what I have already suggested —   
that the reformers evolved their psychological skills by combining   
elements from their cultural heritage and their own revolutionary   
needs with principles of Russian Communist theory and practice.   
  
One other important factor in the Chinese heritage also played   
a part in the evolution of reform techniques: human-centered psy-   
chological skills. No other civilization has paid so much attention   
to the conduct of human relationships. An American anthropolo-   
gist has claimed that "Chinese culture has developed inter-personal   
relationships to the level of an exquisite and superb art." 11 It is   
not that Chinese are incapable of obtuseness and insensitivity; but   
a particular kind of psychological mindedness has long been culti-   
vated in Chinese life. The Chinese family, with its characteristi-   
cally complicated inner maneuvering, has been an excellent psy-   
chological training ground: in order to be "proper," Chinese children   
have had to leam to be aware of the emotional currents in their   
milieu. And this personal emphasis has extended from the family   
  
origins 397   
  
into the rest of Chinese life: whether performing official duties or   
seeking personal objectives, Chinese have always put great stress on   
exerting influence upon the people involved — and there is only a fine   
line between influence and manipulation. These human-centered   
skills have been carefully nurtured over centuries, and emphasized   
at the expense of technical achievements (even the gods play psy-   
chological games). 12 In this sense, thought reform is the modern   
totalitarian expression of a national genius.   
  
But the spirit in which these human-centered skills are used in   
thought reform is certainly alien to the traditional Chinese cultural   
style. In the past, the stress was upon individual and social harmony;   
the ideal was that of quiet wisdom and unbroken calm. The chun-   
tze, or superior Confucian man, was expected to be contemplative   
and reserved in his bearing: "the master was mild yet dignified;   
majestic and yet not fierce; respectful and yet easy." 13 Above all,   
he was to be in full control of his emotions: "if a man be under the   
influence of passion, he will be incorrect in his conduct." 14 For   

----------------------- Page 338-----------------------

the withdrawn Taoist sage, restraint was equally essential: "So   
long as I love calm, the people will be right themselves." 15 Such a   
cultural stress upon moderation, balance, and harmony — which we   
may call a cult of restraint — insures a certain degree of preservation   
of self.   
  
Thought reform has the opposite ethos, a cult of enthusiasm   
(enthusiasm in the religious meaning of rapturous and excessive   
emotional experience), 18 with a demand for total self-surrender. It   
is true that thought reform implies a promise of a return to re-   
straint, and of an attainment of relaxed perfection some time in the   
mystical Communist future, just as Confucius claimed that these   
ideals had existed during an equally mystical past or "golden age" —   
but enthusiasm and restraint, once established, are not always so   
easily controlled.   
  
The spirit of enthusiasm seems to have entered China from the   
outside, carried in on the ideological wings of Western nationalism,   
international Communism, and displaced Judeo-Christian demands   
for ecstatic repentance and histrionic remorse. Yet the intellectual   
descendants of the staid literati have shown themselves to be quite   
capable of orgiastic display — in fact, more capable of it than their   
counterparts in Western Communist countries who have a much   
greater tradition for this type of emotional excess. Apparently any   
  
398 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
culture, or any person within a culture, is potentially capable of   
either restraint or enthusiasm, depending upon individual and col-   
lective historical experience. Those cultures in which restraint has   
been long maintained (again we may use the analogy of the individ-   
ual) are likely to experience an explosive emotional breakthrough   
once the restraint begins to loosen; and the new enthusiasm be-   
comes the means of putting to rout what remains of the older   
pattern.   
  
Just as thought reform draws upon psychological skills of both   
traditional China and Western Communism, it also brings out   
the inquisitional tendencies of both worlds. From each of the two   
great cultural streams, it stresses what is most illiberal. Inquisitorial   
dogmatism, skillful human-centered manipulation, and ecstatic en-   
thusiasm combine within it to produce an awesome quality. Con-   
sequently, relatively moderate Russian and Eastern European Com-   
munists look warily at China's totalism (and Stalinism); and   
people like Bishop Barker (something of an enthusiast himself)   
envy the energies and the psychological cleverness of a respected   
rival. For in breaking out of its traditional cult of restraint, while   
retaining its old penchant for the reordering of human emotions,   
China has created a cult of enthusiasm of such proportions that it   
must startle even the most immoderate Christian or Communist   
visionary.

CHAPTER   
  
CULTURAL PERSPECTIVES: IMPACT   
  
How have the majority of Chinese intellectuals re-   
sponded to the cult of enthusiasm? Has thought re-   
form really been successful with them? What has been its imme-   
diate and long-range impact upon them? These questions demanded   
a follow-up evaluation of the continuing thought reform program.   
  
The evaluation had to be made cautiously, since most Chinese   
intellectuals remain within China, quite inaccessible to me. Yet I   
believe I have enough evidence to make a few generalizations   
—evidence derived from my original research, from Chinese Com-   
munist press reports of the next few years, and from my follow-up   
visit to Hong Kong during the summer of 1958.   
  
Most of my Chinese subjects had participated in the first great   
national wave of thought reform which took place from 1948 to   
1952. These were the years of maximum activity in the revolutionary   
universities (afterward, many of them were converted into more   
conventional Marxist-Leninist training centers), of sweeping re-   
forms in regular universities, and of the histrionic early campaigns   
— "The Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries," the hsileh hsi pro-   
gram, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the ideologi-   
cal struggles of "culture workers" (everyone concerned with the   
arts) centering around the motion picture The Life of Wu Hsun,   
and the Thought Reform Campaign itself. My subjects' accounts   
of these campaigns always included a description of others' re-   
  
399   
  
4OO THOUGHT REFORM   
  
sponses along with their own. I also made a point of asking each of   
them to estimate the general effects of thought reform within his   
immediate environment.   
  
The estimates I got were remarkably consistent, and were also   
confirmed by other Chinese and Westerners who had been in   
China at the time. I was led to the conclusion that thought reform,   
at least during its early phase, had been much more successful with   
Chinese than with Westerners — largely because of the immense   
appeal of nationalism, the reinforcement of thought reform by the   
Chinese Communist environment, the sense of belonging to a   
group within one's own society, as well as many of the other histori-   
cal and cultural influences already mentioned. Yet it was possible to   
identify in the Chinese intellectuals three kinds of response roughly   
analogous to (although by no means the same as) those I have de-   
scribed in Westerners.   
  
Chinese zealous converts underwent a profound religious ex-   

----------------------- Page 340-----------------------

perience. They regarded thought reform as fine and ennobling and   
felt genuinely reborn, along with their society. The zealous convert   
was usually youthful, either an adolescent or a young adult. Al-   
though he may not have been completely free of inner doubt even   
after his thought reform, his conversion was generally much more   
profound than that of the apparent converts among the Westerners.   
(This was, after all, his world, and in it his future seemed un-   
limited.) None of my subjects fit exactly into this category; of   
them, George Chen's early responses came closest. Perhaps better   
examples of zealous converts were the middle-school and university   
students around him whom he described as being completely im-   
mersed in the general enthusiasm. It was probably true that a   
sizable number, perhaps even a majority, of Chinese between the   
ages of fifteen and twenty-two were at that time zealous converts.   
The incidence of conversion apparently decreased in direct propor-   
tion to age, and most of my informants expressed the opinion that   
thirty was an important dividing line. Zealous converts were prob-   
ably rare in the upper age groups, and they seemed to be a dis-   
tinct minority among Chinese intellectuals as a whole.   
  
At the other extreme were the resisters, those who felt suffocated   
by the program and considered it bad and coercive. As with some of   
my subjects (Mr. Hu and Grace Wu for instance), they were apt   
to have been a good deal more sympathetic to Communism before   
  
IMPACT 4OI   
  
their reform than after. But the resister who stayed in China could   
not, at least during this early period, reveal himself; clear-cut acts   
of resistance were virtually confined to the few who fled. And the re-   
sponses of those who did leave China led me to conclude that the   
program had been massive enough to make even the resister ques-   
tion his own attitude and feel guilty for being against the majority   
— perhaps even more guilty than the Western apparent resister   
felt. It is probable that the resisters were most frequently older in-   
tellectuals, especially those who in the past had been significantly   
exposed to the West. But resisters too seemed to constitute a   
minority among Chinese intellectuals.   
  
The most usual response lay between these two extremes, and   
most Chinese intellectuals may be called adapters. An adapter was   
partially but not entirely convinced by the program; essentially he   
was concerned with the problems of coping with a stressful ex-   
perience and finding a place in the new society. His feelings about   
thought reform may have been similarly complicated; he may have   
experienced it as painful, perhaps even coercive, but at the same   
time possibly beneficial — like medicine which may do some good   
just because it tastes so bad. The adapter, while by no means un -   
affected by ideology, was likely to be (as was Robert Chao) less   
affected by it than either a convert or a resister. Of course, both   
convert and resister also did some adapting. The adapter underwent   
his share of confusion and identity crisis, but not to the extreme   

----------------------- Page 341-----------------------

degree of the obviously confused among Westerners; for he was not   
(except in rare cases) forced to make a sudden transition from one   
world to another. He often tried to dispel his doubts by behaving   
like a zealous convert, and in doing so, may have resembled a   
Western apparent convert immediately after his reform experience.   
In a historical sense, the adapter was following a long-established   
pattern of Chinese intellectuals: accepting the change in dynasty   
as part of the order of things, placing his talents at the disposal of   
the new rulers, and seeing in the reign both good and evil, but not   
enough good to win his absolute enthusiasm nor enough evil to   
provoke his unqualified opposition.   
  
Apart from these response categories, I gained the impression that   
this first wave of thought reform had served the over-all function of   
setting the standards for intellectual and emotional existence under   
Communism. Not only was The Way pointed out, but it was, to a   
  
  
  
402 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
large extent, internally imposed. 1 Early enthusiasm for Communism   
and residual bitterness toward the old regime made this the pe-   
riod of thought reform's greatest opportunity — an opportunity   
furthered by the patriotic sentiments aroused by the Korean war,   
and by the special campaign appeals ("Resist America, Aid Korea,"   
"Enlist For The Army," and even the hygiene enthusiasms) which   
went along with it. But we cannot judge the effects of this initial   
phase of thought reform without examining the events which fol-   
lowed.   
  
After two years of relative ideological calm, Chinese intellectuals   
were swept up into the second great wave of thought reform cam-   
paigns. During 1954 and 1955, organized emotional frenzy was re-   
newed — first over the lingering "poisons" related to the liberalism   
of Hu Shih; then over the proper critical approach to the novel,   
The Dream of the Red Chamber; and then over the "criminal acts"   
of the independently-minded left-wing writer and former disciple   
of Lu Hsun, Hu Feng. Each of these campaigns served to stimulate   
new displays of confession and repentance, and each outdid its   
predecessor in thought reform efforts; the vituperative intensity and   
the scope of this second jvave of thought reform were, if anything,   
even greater than those of the first.   
  
Yet when the frenzy of this push-button enthusiasm had abated,   
the Party leaders indicated that there was still much more to be   
accomplished, and in late 1955 and early  1956 convened a series   
of conferences on "the question of intellectuals." At one of these,   
Chou En-lai expressed the belief that great progress had been made,   
and quoted from surveys: "According to statistical data on 141   
teachers in four higher institutes of Peking, Tientsin and Tsingtao,   
for example, in the past six years the progressive elements have in-   

----------------------- Page 342-----------------------

creased from 18 per cent to 41 per cent, while the backward ele-   
ments were reduced from 28 per cent to 1 5 per cent." 2 He summed   
up his statistics as follows: 40 per cent were "progressive elements"   
actively supporting the regime; 40 per cent were "middle-of-the-road   
elements" who supported the regime but were "not sufficiently pro-   
gressive"; a little over 10 per cent were "backward elements" who   
"lack political consciousness or ideologically oppose socialism";   
and "only a few per cent" — presumably the rest — were "counter-   
revolutionaries and other bad elements." Chou of course concluded   
that intellectuals require "continued ideological reform," but his   
  
IMPACT 403   
  
tone was conciliatory, and he proposed a series of improvements   
(soon put into effect) in general working and living conditions re-   
lating to such things as housing, salary, equipment, and availability   
of needed reference materials. He proposed that five-sixths of in-   
tellectuals' working time, or forty hours a week, be made available   
for their professional activities; the remaining time was to be used   
for "political study, attending necessary meetings, and taking part   
in social activity." This soft approach contrasted sharply with the   
vindictive excesses of the recently-completed Hu Fung campaign,   
and it inaugurated the third and perhaps most remarkable of all   
thought reform phases — the period of the "Hundred Flowers."   
  
That the Communists should adopt as a slogan the phrase,   
"Let the hundred flowers bloom, let the hundred schools of thought   
contend" (a classical allusion to the hundred schools of philosophy   
which flourished during the Chou Dynasty before Confucianism   
became the official ideology) was ironic enough, but no less ironic   
than the events which followed. Mao Tse-tung is said to have first   
suggested the expression in an unpublished address before a Party   
conference in May, 1956; and it was first publicly stated a few weeks   
later by the director of propaganda of the Party's Central Com-   
mittee. Thought reform was to continue, but thought reform of a   
new kind: there was to be "freedom of independent thinking, free-   
dom of debate, freedom of creative work, freedom to criticize, to   
express one's own views." 3   
  
Intellectuals were understandably slow to respond to the invita-   
tion until it was again extended by Mao himself almost a year   
later in his widely publicized speech, "On the Correct Handling   
of Contradictions among the People," and still again in another   
speech a few weeks later. The invitation was then formalized into a   
national campaign for the "Rectification of Party Members," and   
the strange spectacle was seen of all the usual organizational   
paraphernalia — newspaper editorials, radio and loud-speaker broad-   
casts, and word of mouth evangelizing — being directed at provoking   
criticism (constructive, of course) of Communist Party members.   
The idea behind the campaign was apparently a tentative policy   
of liberalization, a controlled opportunity for non-Party intellectuals   
to vent their grievances and thereby improve their working relation-   

----------------------- Page 343-----------------------

ship with the Party. In converting the invitation to a command per-   
formance, Communist leaders may have been influenced by an un-   
  
404 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
easiness they sensed in the intellectuals, about events elsewhere in   
the Communist world (the Hungarian uprising and the publication   
of Khrushchev's speech on Stalin), and about economic difficulties   
within China.   
  
In any case, it was all meant to be a friendly version of thought   
reform. Everyone was to speak out freely and air the "contradic-   
tions" between the leaders and the led. There were to be no mass   
meetings or "struggles," only small discussion groups and "com-   
radely heart to heart talks"; the campaign was to be carried out,   
according to its directive, "as gently as a breeze or a mild rain."   
  
But when the intellectuals finally spoke out, the "mild rain"   
quickly assumed hurricane proportions. Far from limiting them-   
selves to polite suggestions, they bitterly criticised every phase of   
Communist rule, including Party infallibility, the benevolence   
of the Peking regime, and the integrity of Mao Tse-tung himself.   
One group of intellectuals (sometimes sounding like the Yugoslav   
Communist, Milovan Djilas) centered their fire upon the Party's   
abuse of power and privileges: a newspaper editor complained that   
the Party was highhanded ("I think a Party leading the nation is   
not the same as a Party owning the nation" ) ; other critics equated   
Communist leadership with traditional despotism ("Local em-   
perors," "Party dynasty," "empire of the Party"), and urged high   
Communist officials to "alight from their sedan-chairs"; still others   
condemned the priority given to Party members in such matters as   
promotion, living subsidies, medical care, school facilities for chil-   
dren, and opportunities to travel abroad.   
  
Many intellectuals said that their initial enthusiasm for Com-   
munism had given way to disillusionment. A lecturer in science   
warned the regime that things had gotten so bad that unless it gave   
up its "arrogant and conceited" attitudes, "the masses will bring   
you down, kill the Communists, and overthrow you."   
  
One university professor, after an articulate statement on the   
limitations of Marxism-Leninism ("no doctrine can embody the   
whole truth" ) , had the audacity to suggest that it be dispensed with   
as an ideological guide. Others advocated the formation of genuine   
opposition parties, free elections, and other elements of parliamen-   
tary democracy. The absence of civil rights and legal safeguards was   
noted, and the regime's constitution was denounced as a "scrap   
of paper not observed by the Party." Critics condemned Com-   
  
IMPACT 405   
  
munist manipulation of information; and one journalist chided   

----------------------- Page 344-----------------------

the country's newspapers for "playing the role of a notice board, a   
gramophone, and a pirated edition of a book"; another objected to   
the practice of reproducing editorials from the People's Daily —   
the spokesman of the Peking regime — in newspapers throughout   
China, pointing out that "the editorials of the New York Times   
are not reproduced by other American papers."   
  
And perhaps most important, many of the critics struck out at   
thought reform itself. A Peking University professor minced no   
words : "I find the term thought reform rather repulsive. ... I am   
not aware that there is anything wrong with my thought. . . . No   
style of thought is made up entirely of cream or scum." Many   
condemned the abuses of the national campaigns ("People who   
have gone through these movements will remember the terror and   
feel their flesh creep whenever they think of them") and demanded   
that the Party admit its mistakes in humiliating, imprisoning, and   
even putting to death many innocent people. One highranking   
government official referred to the repeated re-education programs   
as "disgusting," and felt that rather than winning over the intel-   
lectuals, they had done much to embitter them. Others found the   
programs "a total mistake" and "rotten to the core," claiming that   
thought reform "has made everybody live in insecurity," and using   
such terms as "assault on the person" and "blindfold of the mind."   
  
Some of the most heated criticisms were made by Communist   
Party members. One compared the relationship between the leaders   
and the led (placing intellectuals in the latter category) to that   
between mistress and slave girl:   
  
A slave girl is the dowry or appendage of her mistress. She has to win   
the favor and avoid the hate of her mistress. In her spiritual world there   
are only submission and flattery. She looks upon the swallowing of the   
saliva of her mistress as an honor. This is the true philosophy of the   
slave girl.   
  
Another, in condemning Party orthodoxy, defended his own "rebel-   
lious character," and quoted Maxim Gorki's phrase, "Man comes   
into the world to rebel." Still another expressed the dilemma of a   
Party member asked to participate actively in the rectification cam-   
paign and at the same time observe Party discipline: "This amounts   
to sealing our mouth while expecting us to speak."   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
This critical outburst was permitted to last for about one month,   
during which time the Party leadership apparently experienced   
hesitancy and confusion. Although they had themselves set off the   
campaign, they seemed to be totally unprepared for its vehemence.   
At the beginning, Party organs praised its own critics for their   
participation in the "blooming and contending," and for having   
become "inflamed with enthusiasm." After that, there were a few   
expressions of concern about the tone of the criticisms, but still no   

----------------------- Page 345-----------------------

clear policy was taken about them.   
  
Finally, six weeks after the beginning of the rectification move-   
ment, a full-scale counterattack was launched. An editorial in the   
Peking People's Daily, appropriately entitled, "What is This For?",   
gave the signal for a reversal of the critical tide. It labeled the most   
outspoken critics "rightist elements," and accused them (accurately   
enough) of "challenging the political leadership of the Communist   
Party . . . and even openly clamoring for the Party's 'quitting the   
stage' ... in the name of 'helping the Communist Party rectify   
its working style.' " In subsequent editorials (and presumably in   
instructions passed down through the Party's ranks), the order was   
given to oppose "incorrect criticisms" and "firmly develop correct   
countercriticisms." Soon it was the critics themselves (no longer   
simply "rightist elements" but "bourgeois rightists"), rather than   
Party members, who were being "rectified." These critics then be-   
came targets of the most extreme "ideological struggle" and the   
most abusive hostility, as the "blooming and contending" abruptly   
gave way to a new "Anti-Rightist Campaign." Many of them were   
accused of participating in the subversive "Chang-Lo alliance"   
(Chang and Lo, both leading members of "democratic" parties who   
had held rather high positions in the regime, had been among the   
most outspoken, and were cited as prominent bad examples).   
  
The regime was particularly sensitive about the criticisms of   
thought reform. It countered these with the claim that the Hun-   
dred Flowers incident left no doubt that more, rather than less,   
thought reform was needed, and promised the intellectuals that   
they would in the future be given refresher courses of thought   
reform every year or even every six months. The results of the first   
of these refresher courses soon become apparent. True to form,   
each of the former critics in turn renounced his criticisms of the   
regime; each condemned the remaining bourgeois influences within   
  
IMPACT 407   
  
himself, and many emphasized their having been influenced by   
the notorious "Chang-Lo alliance." Many Party members were   
expelled (not for being themselves "bourgeois rightists," but for   
having allegedly been influenced by them), critics were removed   
from office, some were arrested, and there were reports of suicides,   
and even of executions. The soft policy toward intellectuals was   
suddenly replaced by hard disdain: intellectuals were ridiculed,   
unfavorably compared (even in regard to intelligence) with "the   
masses," told that it was necessary to be first "Red" and then "ex-   
pert," and in many cases were sent to rural areas to leam their   
lessons. The experiment with liberalization was over and the old   
variety of thought reform was back.   
  
One particularly significant aspect of the Hundred Flowers out-   
burst was the behavior of China's students. In 1958, I obtained   
firsthand descriptions of this behavior from two young men who had   

----------------------- Page 346-----------------------

participated in the campaign the year before while attending uni-   
versities in Peking. Their reports on the attitudes of university   
students — the age group which has been most responsive to thought   
reform — were extremely revealing.   
  
Both were in their early twenties; in 1957 Wang had been a   
junior at Tsing Hua, and Li a senior at Peking University. Each    
had gone through thought reform at middle school; both had then   
shared in the general sense of exhilaration and had accepted the   
Communist point of view fully, though Li felt that because he was   
a Christian, he might have been a bit less enthusiastic than some   
of the others. Both described the strong impact upon the Chi-   
nese students of events in European Communist countries — Khru-   
shchev's denunciation of Stalin, the Hungarian revolution, and un-   
rest of Polish intellectuals— despite the limited and highly-slanted   
coverage of these events in the Chinese Communist press. Since   
many students had, according to Li, a "religious" belief in Com-   
munism's perfection, their disillusion was "like that of a person with   
a sincere belief in God who suddenly discovers there is no God." He   
said the Hungarian revolution was particularly important to them,   
and estimated that only about one-third of the students accepted   
without question the Party's official version that it was a reactionary   
uprising brought about by American imperialist activity. Reports of   
Russian intervention bothered the students, although most even-   
tually rationalized this as "probably necessary to preserve socialism."   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
Li himself shared the general feeling of uneasiness and had an urge   
to "talk to the others about these things."   
  
Wang stressed the effects of Khrushchev's revelations about   
Stalin. I asked him how he and the other students had learned about   
this, since the Chinese Communist regime, deeply identified as it   
was with Stalinism, had suppressed most of the details. Wang gave   
a surprising answer: someone had discovered the text of the speech   
in a copy of the New York Daily Worker in a library. The Worker   
was, of course, the only American newspaper available to students.   
This information was spread by word-of-mouth, and many students   
went to the library to read the speech. It was a shock to them to   
learn that the Russian system was "not democratic" and that the   
man held up to them as such a humane leader, whose writings they   
used in their courses, had put so many people to death.   
  
Both Li and Wang emphasized, however, that almost 90 per cent   
of the students were members of the Communist Youth Corps,   
and that the students continued to identify themselves with the   
regime. Some consoled themselves with their faith that Chinese   
Communism was superior to European Communism. Although   
occasionally aware that individual freedom was curtailed, they   
did not experience a continuous sense of suppression, and were   
usually "too busy studying to think too much about it." But Li   

----------------------- Page 347-----------------------

thought that in 1957 most students would have favored China's   
following Poland's example in granting additional self-expression,   
although few said so outright.   
  
In any case, in the months just before the release of Hundred   
Flowers emotions both Li and Wang were aware of widespread   
"restlessness" and "frustration." The students, like their teachers,   
were slow to respond to the invitation to speak out. But when they   
did, they were second to none in the vigor of their criticisms, and   
much more prone than other groups to convert their sentiments into   
action. As usual, it was Peking University which led all the rest.   
  
There the students set up a "Democratic Wall," a large bulletin   
board devoted to criticism and protest. The wall space near the   
bulletin board was devoted to the same purpose, and, true to the   
horticultural metaphor, was called "The Garden of Democracy."   
Students, individually or in groups, prepared sharp commentaries,   
satirical poems, cartoons, and slogans. And soon, as the Party press   
reported, "enthusiastic discussions and debates were developed near   
  
IMPACT 409   
  
the walls, in the dormitories, in the passageways of the classrooms,   
or on the meadows by the side of the lake." The spontaneous debate   
was "like in Hyde Park," and "the atmosphere of free contention   
engulfed the whole university." Students brought up the same   
complaints as other critics. They also raised issues particularly im-   
portant to them as a group. They complained of the Party's arbi-   
trary control over their programs of study and of their later job   
assignments; they asked for free expression of student opinion; they   
praised the "courageous" actions of their fellow-students in Hungary   
and Poland. One of the most persistent themes, expressed both on   
the bulletin board and during debates, was, "We should find out   
what freedom and democracy mean."   
  
At one point, a Party official tried to restrain the Peking Univer-   
sity students, and told them that bulletin boards were "not a good   
medium" for the rectification campaign. But this attitude was   
bitterly denounced on the Democratic Wall, and soon afterward   
a higher official apologized to the students for the erroneous views   
of his subordinate. And according to Li, many Party members and   
Youth Corps leaders from among the students were in the vanguard   
of the protest activities.   
  
Very quickly, Democratic Walls appeared at universities all over   
China (press reports and letters exchanged among students had   
publicized the original). Wang told me that Khrushchev's anti-   
Stalin speech was posted on Tsing Hua's Democratic Wall. In some   
other cities, the students acted with even greater vehemence,   
staging riots, beating up Party members, and destroying Party prop-   
erty. Prominent among the demonstrators were middle-school   
students. Once more there was student agitation in China, but   

----------------------- Page 348-----------------------

this time the Communists were its targets rather than its bene-   
ficiaries.   
  
Immediately after the "What is This For?" editorial, however,   
Party members and supporters were able to gain full control of   
university environments. The students abruptly ceased their pro-   
tests, and the attack upon "rightists" in their ranks began. Accord-   
ing to Li, students were not surprised when the government stepped   
in; but they did resent its rough treatment of those who had spoken   
out. Li said that many of the students who had previously been   
most vehement in their criticisms were now the loudest voices in   
the anti-rightist chorus, and compared their actions to the betrayal   
  
410 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
of Jesus by his own disciple.   
  
The government made sure that the counterattack was launched   
from Peking University. A reorganized Peking University student   
association sent an open letter to student leaders in all of the other   
major universities, denouncing "rightist activities," and support-   
ing the government's countermeasures. The Democratic Wall was   
retained; but the essays, poems, and cartoons on it now attacked the   
"rightists," and its new slogan— posted in large whitewashed char-   
acters — read: "Any word or act alienated from Socialism is com-   
pletely erroneous."   
  
Li estimated that about one-third of the students agreed fully   
with the government's intervention, feeling it necessary and just;   
the sentiments among the rest varied greatly — some were bitterly   
resentful, others of two minds, and still others blandly compliant.   
Many students, in explaining these difficult matters to themselves   
and to each other, resorted to traditional Chinese ideas about the   
rise and fall of great dynasties; they concluded that since Commu-   
nism had been active in China for only about twenty-five years, it   
had "not yet used up its history," and one might as well continue   
to support it.   
  
Li told me that he had decided to leave China because he feared   
that if he ever expressed his resentments about the regime, he might   
cause difficulty for himself and others. Chang gave similar reasons;   
during the Hundred Flowers campaign he had compared Stalin to   
Hitler, and spoken out strongly against Party control of the uni-   
versity, so that he felt that his position was already precarious. Nor   
were his apprehensions unfounded: the People's Daily had already   
announced that graduates of Peking University were to be subjected   
to a special "political examination" consisting of a detailed scrutiny   
of their attitudes and behavior during the "anti-rightist struggle."   
The results of this examination were to be kept as official records   
and used as a basis for job assignments: "We will never let anyone   
politically questionable assume duties that he should not assume."   
And during the wave of thought reform which followed, many   

----------------------- Page 349-----------------------

students and recent graduates were sent to work in the countryside,   
many others placed under various forms of special surveillance, and   
a few were sent to prison for reform through labor.   
  
I believe the Hundred Flowers episode has great significance for   
an evaluation of thought reform's effectiveness. One cannot draw   
  
IMPACT 411   
  
statistical conclusions from an event so massively emotional; and   
there is no way of knowing what percentage of Chinese intellectuals   
shared the feelings of the regime's critics. Yet the sudden intensity   
of both the antiregime outburst and the "anti-rightist" counter-   
attack illuminate the limitations as well as the accomplishments of   
the thought reform program.   
  
Looking first at the program's limitations, the Hundred Flowers   
incident reveals the potential of a reform-saturated environment   
for a sudden reversal of sentiment, for the release of bitter emotions   
directed both at thought reform and at the regime which per-   
petuates it. Behind such a reversal lies the latent resentment which   
thought reform builds up in varying degrees within virtually all who   
are exposed to it. This resentment originates in a basic human   
aversion to excessive personal control, a phenomenon which I call   
the hostility of suffocation (discussed further in Part IV). Thought   
reform constantly provokes this hostility, first by stimulating it   
within individual participants, and then by creating conditions of   
group intensity which can magnify it to frenzy. In other words,   
thought reform is able to promote an emotional contagion — of   
resentment as well as enthusiasm. These emotions are closely re-   
lated, and easily changed from one to the other. Individual feelings   
of hostility and resentment toward reform may exist consciously,   
or may be deeply repressed, but when encouraged by external con-   
ditions, they can emerge suddenly and unexpectedly.   
  
One external condition which encourages their expression is the   
release of environmental controls. This in turn leads to the break-   
down of the individual's defense mechanisms, particularly repres-   
sion, which ordinarily keep resentment in check. Thus, liberaliza-   
tion of the milieu can create a quick surge of resentment, which   
mounts until it is again forced underground by the restoration of   
a suppressive atmosphere. This leads to more hostility of suffoca-   
tion, and thought reform is then on a treadmill of extremism.   
  
Another limitation in the effectiveness of thought reform is its   
dependency on the maintenance of a closed system of communica-   
tion, on an idea-tight milieu control. If information from the out-   
side which contradicts thought reform's message breaks through   
this milieu control, it can also be a stimulus for resentment. This   
was true of the news from Hungary, Russia, and Poland at the   
time of the Hundred Flowers. As the students' use of the New York   
  

----------------------- Page 350-----------------------

412 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
Daily Worker reveals, the increase in international communication   
makes strict milieu control difficult to maintain; and if information   
from outside includes evidence of brutality within the Communist   
system, the hostility of suffocation becomes combined with a sense   
of having been betrayed.   
  
The break in milieu control need not come from so great a dis-   
tance: life experiences within Communist China, outside of the   
immediate thought reform process, can also serve the same func-   
tion. Thus, thought reform extolled the brilliance of the Commu-   
nist Party's economic planning, but Chinese intellectuals, like   
everyone else, were suffering from shortages; thought reform   
preached austerity, but intellectuals saw a privileged class of Party   
members emerge. This kind of information is of course even more   
accessible to a thought reform participant than news from the out-   
side world. All of which suggests that thought reform cannot be   
conducted in a vacuum; milieu control can never be complete. The   
one-sided visions of thought reform are always threatened by the   
world without, a world which will neither live up to these visions   
nor cease to undermine them.   
  
The Hundred Flowers experience also seems to indicate that   
thought reform is subject to a law of diminishing conversions. Re-   
peated attempts to reform the same man are more likely to increase   
his hostility of suffocation than to purge him of his "incorrect"   
thoughts. With each histrionic show of repentance, his conversion   
becomes more suspect. This hypothesis is confirmed by the revised   
official estimates of the intellectuals' ideological status after the   
Hundred Flowers episode. In 1958, commentators placed "only a   
few" of China's intellectuals in the category of fully acceptable   
"working class intellectuals" (fewer than Chou En-lai's 1956 esti-   
mate of 40 per cent), characterizing the majority of intellectuals as   
"middle-of-the-roaders" (more than Chou's 1956 estimate of 40 per   
cent). Although these estimates are hardly precise (they may have   
been exaggerated to spur the intellectuals on to greater efforts),   
the Hundred Flowers incident itself suggests that they may cor-   
rectly indicate a trend. By "middle-of-the-roaders," the Commu-   
nists did not mean "bourgeois rightists" (who presumably had al-   
ready been dealt with), but rather those intellectuals who had   
reacted with emotional passivity and partial withdrawal to an over-   
dose of thought reform. Such passive tendencies can be observed   
  
IMPACT 413   
  
in Chinese intellectuals (Robert Chao, for instance) who are faced   
with unpleasant environmental realities. At the beginning, perhaps,   
thought reform can frequently break through these patterns and   
even utilize the emotional conflicts which accompany them; but   
over a period of time it runs the risk of itself stimulating a protec-   
tive inner passivity and withdrawal even among those who outwardly   

----------------------- Page 351-----------------------

seem active and involved.   
  
The Chinese Communists seem to interpret these passive tend-   
encies not as evidences of too much reform but rather of too little,   
and their treatment is always the same — more reform. We can only   
conclude that Chinese leaders are by no means as logical and calmly   
methodical about their reform programs as many outsiders assume   
them to be. Indeed, they themselves appear to be caught up in an   
irrational urge to reform, an urge which frequently works against   
their own interests. I estimate that thought reform's maximum   
(post-takeover) effectiveness was reached sometime during its first   
wave (about 1951 or 1952), and that after this the balance between   
enthusiasm and coercion has shifted to a decrease of the former   
and an increase of the latter. This too is part of the Communist   
leaders' own treadmill, since it means that they can neither achieve   
their perfectionistic thought reform goals, nor cease trying to; and   
every wave of thought reform makes the next wave even more   
necessary. The stagers of thought reform are in this sense the vic-   
tims of their own cult of enthusiasm.   
  
Yet all of this is just one side of the story. The repetitive waves   
of thought reform diminish spontaneity and stimulate resentment,   
but they also help to achieve what is perhaps thought reform's   
major goal, the rapid establishment of a Chinese Communist   
ideological culture — a prescribed system of feeling and belief against   
which everything is critically judged. A variation of thought re-   
form got the Party into difficulty during the Hundred Flowers out-   
burst; a hyperorthodox thought reform came to the rescue. Al-   
though the counterattack was neither as significant nor as un-   
expected as the critical outburst which preceded it, the almost im-   
mediate recantation made by all who had spoken out was nearly as   
impressive a spectacle, and was certainly a highly convincing dis-   
play of the recuperative powers of thought reform. Those who   
recanted must have been very fearful, and their performances were   
perhaps even more than usually ritualistic. Yet they may also have   
  
  
414 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
felt some genuine repentance, for thought reform had applied to   
them its special techniques for reclaiming backsliders. By its mobili-   
zation of mass emotions, it could have convinced them that their   
critical views were out of step with the march of history, and that   
they had helped their country's enemies and harmed a noble cause.   
Thought reform can so envelop the backslider in his guilt that,   
however sincere his original protest, he is made to doubt himself   
enough to return to the fold — if not as a true believer, then as a   
humiliated, fearful, confused, and impotent follower. We saw ves-   
tiges of this reclaiming power in many of my subjects: the guilty   
sense of having been a betrayer, along with a paralyzing fear of the   
Communists (especially in Hu and in George Chen), persisting   
long after the escape from Communist control. For thought reform   

----------------------- Page 352-----------------------

achieves a degree of psychological control over the individual as   
strong as any yet devised.   
  
Accompanying this control is thought reform's extraordinary   
capacity for personal manipulation. We need not accept, of course,   
the regime's later claim to infallibility in relationship to the Hun-   
dred Flowers episode — its innuendoes that it had inaugurated the   
campaign in order to expose the "poisonous weeds" (a view also   
held by many cynical outsiders). The evidence suggests that the   
Communists were as surprised as anyone else at the response. Yet   
this ex post facto claim does have a kernel of truth: for in any   
system as total as thought reform, liberalization is at best a device,   
a purposeful technique rather than an expression of genuine con-   
viction. Thought reform manipulates the sequence of suffocation-   
liberalization-suffocation, and in so doing ensures that Communist   
realities remain at the center of the stage, whatever the degree of   
enthusiasm or resentment of the players.   
  
I am aware that I have presented versions of thought reform's   
limitations and accomplishments which seem almost contradic-   
tory. I have done this intentionally, because these opposing effects   
can and do co-exist, sometimes even within the same person. A true   
picture of the program's impact can only be obtained by visualizing   
within the emotional life of individual Chinese intellectuals a fluc-   
tuating complex of genuine enthusiasm, neutral compliance, passive   
withdrawal, and hostility of suffocation — along with a tendency to   
accept much that is unpleasant because it seems to be a necessary   
part of a greater program, or the only way to get things done.   
  
IMPACT 415   
  
Will thought reform continue indefinitely? No one can be sure.   
Its intensity may diminish as the Chinese Communists move be-   
yond the acute ideological stage of revolution. This would be in   
keeping with their contention that the need for thought reform   
arises solely from the contaminations of the old order: new genera-   
tions of intellectuals, brought up entirely under Communism,   
should — according to this logic — have no reason to reform. Yet   
matters may not turn out to be quite so simple. The psychological   
forces which originally set thought reform in motion will continue   
to be felt; and perhaps for as long as this strange marriage be-   
tween Communism and Chinese culture remains solvent (despite   
the early clash of temperaments, the union looks like an enduring   
one), Chinese intellectuals will find themselves subjected to some   
kind of periodic "rectification."

CHAPTER   
  
IDEOLOGICAL TOTALISM   
  
Thought reform has a psychological momentum of   
its own, a self -perpetuating energy not always bound   
by the interests of the program's directors. When we inquire into   
the sources of this momentum, we come upon a complex set of   
psychological themes, which may be grouped under the general   
heading of ideological totalism. By this ungainly phrase I mean   
to suggest the coming together of immoderate ideology with equally   
immoderate individual character traits — an extremist meeting ground   
between people and ideas.   
  
In discussing tendencies toward individual totalism within my   
subjects, I made it clear that these were a matter of degree, and   
that some potential for this form of all-or-nothing emotional align-   
ment exists within everyone. Similarly, any ideology — that is, any   
set of emotionally-charged convictions about man and his rela-   
tionship to the natural or supernatural world — may be carried by   
its adherents in a totalistic direction. But this is most likely to   
occur with those ideologies which are most sweeping in their   
content and most ambitious — or messianic — in their claims, whether   
religious, political, or scientific. And where totalism exists, a re-   
ligion, a political movement, or even a scientific organization be-   
comes little more than an exclusive cult.   
  
A discussion of what is most central in the thought reform en-   
vironment can thus lead us to a more general consideration of the   
  
419   
  

----------------------- Page 354-----------------------

420 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
psychology of human zealotry. For in identifying, on the basis of   
this study of thought reform, features common to all expressions of   
ideological totalism, I wish to suggest a set of criteria against which   
any environment may be judged — a basis for answering the ever-   
recurring question: "Isn't this just like 'brainwashing'?"   
  
These criteria consist of eight psychological themes which are   
predominant within the social field of the thought reform milieu.   
Each has a totalistic quality; each depends upon an equally ab-   
solute philosophical assumption; and each mobilizes certain in-   
dividual emotional tendencies, mostly of a polarizing nature. Psy-   
chological theme, philosophical rationale, and polarized individual   
tendencies are interdependent; they require, rather than directly   
cause, each other. In combination they create an atmosphere which   
may temporarily energize or exhilarate, but which at the same   
time poses the gravest of human threats.   
  
Milieu Control   
  
The most basic feature of the thought reform environment, the   
psychological current upon which all else depends, is the control   
of human communication. Through this milieu control the totalist   
environment seeks to establish domain over not only the individ-   
ual's communication with the outside (all that he sees and hears,   
reads and writes, experiences, and expresses), but also — in its   
penetration of his inner life— over what we may speak of as his   
communication with himself. It creates an atmosphere uncom-   
fortably reminiscent of George Orwell's 1984; but with one im-   
portant difference. Orwell, as a Westerner, envisioned milieu con-   
trol accomplished by a mechanical device, the two-way "tele-   
screen." The Chinese, although they utilize whatever mechanical   
means they have at their disposal, achieve control of greater psycho-   
logical depth through a human recording and transmitting ap-   
paratus. It is probably fair to say that the Chinese Communist   
prison and revolutionary university produce about as thoroughly   
controlled a group environment as has ever existed. The milieu   
control exerted over the broader social environment of Communist   
China, while considerably less intense, is in its own way unrivalled   
in its combination of extensiveness and depth; it is, in fact, one of   
the distinguishing features of Chinese Communist practice.   
  
IDEOLOGICAL TOTALISM 42 1   
  
Such milieu control never succeeds in becoming absolute; and   
its own human apparatus can — when permeated by outside informa-   
tion — become subject to discordant "noise" beyond that of any   
mechanical apparatus. To totalist administrators, however, such   
occurrences are no more than evidences of "incorrect" use of the   
apparatus. For they look upon milieu control as a just and neces-   
sary policy, one which need not be kept secret: thought reform   

----------------------- Page 355-----------------------

participants may be in doubt as to who is telling what to whom,   
but the fact that extensive information about everyone is being   
conveyed to the authorities is always known. At the center of this   
self-justification is thei r assumption of omniscience, their conviction   
that reality is their exclusive possession. Having experienced the   
impact of what they consider to be an ultimate truth (and having   
the need to dispel any possible inner doubts of their own) , they con-   
sider it their duty to create an environment containing no more   
and no less than this "truth." In order to be the engineers of the   
human soul, they must first bring it under full observational con-   
trol.   
  
Many things happen psychologically to one exposed to milieu   
control; the most basic is the disruption of balance between self   
and outside world. Pressured toward a merger of internal and ex-   
ternal milieux, the individual encounters a profound threat to his   
personal autonomy. He is deprived of the combination of external   
information and inner reflection which anyone requires to test the   
realities of his environment and to maintain a measure of identity   
separate from it. Instead, he is called upon to make an absolute   
polarization of the real (the prevailing ideology) and the unreal   
(everything else). To the extent that he does this, he undergoes a   
personal closure 1 which frees him from man's incessant struggle   
with the elusive subtleties of truth. He may even share his environ-   
ment's sense of omniscience and assume a "God's-eye view" 2 of the   
universe; but he is likely instead to feel himself victimized by the   
God's-eye view of his environment's controllers. At this point he   
is subject to the hostility of suffocation of which we have already   
spoken — the resentful awareness that his strivings toward new in-   
formation, independent judgment, and self-expression are being   
thwarted. If his intelligence and sensibilities carry him toward reali-   
ties outside the closed ideological system, he may resist these as not   
fully legitimate — until the milieu control is sufficiently diminished   
  
422 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
for him to share these realities with others. He is in either case pro-   
foundly hampered in the perpetual human quest for what is true,   
good, and relevant in the world around him and within himself.   
  
Mystical Manipulation   
  
The inevitable next step after milieu control is extensive personal   
manipulation. This manipulation assumes a no-holds-barred char-   
acter, and uses every possible device at the milieu's command, no   
matter how bizarre or painful. Initiated from above, it seeks to   
provoke specific patterns of behavior and emotion in such a way   
that these will appear to have arisen spontaneously from within the   
environment. This element of planned spontaneity, directed as   
it is by an ostensibly omniscient group, must assume, for the   
manipulated, a near-mystical quality.   
  

----------------------- Page 356-----------------------

Ideological totalists do not pursue this approach solely for the   
purpose of maintaining a sense of power over others. Rather they   
are impelled by a special kind of mystique which not only justifies   
such manipulations, but makes them mandatory. Included in this   
mystique is a sense of "higher purpose," of having "directly per-   
ceived some imminent law of social development," and of being   
themselves the vanguard of this development. 3 By thus becoming   
the instruments of their own mystique, they create a mystical aura   
around the manipulating institutions — the Party, the Government,   
the Organization. They are the agents "chosen" (by history, by   
God, or by some other supernatural force) to carry out the "mystical   
imperative," * the pursuit of which must supersede all considera-   
tions of decency or of immediate human welfare. Similarly, any   
thought or action which questions the higher purpose is considered   
to be stimulated by a lower purpose, to be backward, selfish, and   
petty in the face of the great, overriding mission. This same mystical   
imperative produces the apparent extremes of idealism and cynicism   
which occur in connection with the manipulations of any totalist   
environment: even those actions which seem cynical in the extreme   
can be seen as having ultimate relationship to the "higher purpose."   
  
At the level of the individual person, the psychological responses   
to this manipulative approach revolve about the basic polarity of   
trust and mistrust. One is asked to accept these manipulations on a   
basis of ultimate trust (or faith): "like a child in the arms of its   
  
IDEOLOGICAL TOTALISM 423   
  
mother," as Father Luca accurately perceived. He who trusts in   
this degree can experience the manipulations within the idiom of   
the mystique behind them: that is, he may welcome their mysteri-   
ousness, find pleasure in their pain, and feel them to be necessary   
for the fulfillment of the "higher purpose" which he endorses as   
his own. But such elemental trust is difficult to maintain; and even   
the strongest can be dissipated by constant manipulation.   
  
When trust gives way to mistrust (or when trust has never   
existed) the higher purpose cannot serve as adequate emotional   
sustenance. The individual then responds to the manipulations   
through developing what I shall call the psychology of the pawn.   
Feeling himself unable to escape from forces more powerful than   
himself, he subordinates everything to adapting himself to them.   
He becomes sensitive to all kinds of cues, expert at anticipating   
environmental pressures, and skillful in riding them in such a way   
that his psychological energies merge with the tide rather than   
turn painfully against himself. This requires that he participate   
actively in the manipulation of others, as well as in the endless   
round of betrayals and self-betrayals which are required.   
  
But whatever his response — whether he is cheerful in the face of   
being manipulated, deeply resentful, or feels a combination of both   
— he has been deprived of the opportunity to exercise his capacities   

----------------------- Page 357-----------------------

for self-expression and independent action.   
  
The Demand for Purity   
  
In the thought reform milieu, as in all situations of ideological   
totalism, the experiential world is sharply divided into the pure and   
the impure, into the absolutely good and the absolutely evil. The   
good and the pure are of course those ideas, feelings, and actions   
which are consistent with the totalist ideology and policy; anything   
else is apt to be relegated to the bad and the impure. Nothing   
human is immune from the flood of stern moral judgments. All   
"taints" and "poisons" which contribute to the existing state of   
impurity must be searched out and eliminated.   
  
The philosophical assumption underlying this demand is that   
absolute purity (the "good Communist" or the ideal Communist   
state) is attainable, and that anything done to anyone in the name   
of this purity is ultimately moral. In actual practice, however, no   
  
424 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
one (and no State) is really expected to achieve such perfection.   
Nor can this paradox be dismissed as merely a means of establish-   
ing a high standard to which all can aspire. Thought reform bears   
witness to its more malignant consequences: for by defining and   
manipulating the criteria of purity, and then by conducting an   
all-out war upon impurity, the ideological totalises create a narrow   
world of guilt and shame. This is perpetuated by an ethos of   
continuous reform, a demand that one strive permanently and   
painfully for something which not only does not exist but is in fact   
alien to the human condition.   
  
At the level of the relationship between individual and environ-   
ment, the demand for purity creates what we may term a guilty   
milieu and a shaming milieu. Since each man's impurities are   
deemed sinful and potentially harmful to himself and to others,   
he is, so to speak, expected to expect punishment — which results   
in a relationship of guilt with his environment. Similarly, when he   
fails to meet the prevailing standards in casting out such im-   
purities, he is expected to expect humiliation and ostracism — thus   
establishing a relationship of shame with his milieu. Moreover, the   
sense of guilt and the sense of shame become highly-valued: they   
are preferred forms of communication, objects of public com-   
petition, and the bases for eventual bonds between the individual   
and his totalist accusers. One may attempt to simulate them for a   
while, but the subterfuge is likely to be detected, and it is safer   
(as Miss Darrow found) to experience them genuinely.   
  
People vary greatly in their susceptibilities to guilt and shame (as   
my subjects illustrated), depending upon patterns developed early   
in life. But since guilt and shame are basic to human existence, this   
variation can be no more than a matter of degree. Each person is   

----------------------- Page 358-----------------------

made vulnerable through his profound inner sensitivities to his   
own limitations and to his unfulfilled potential; in other words,   
each is made vulnerable through his existential guilt. Since ideo-   
logical totalists become the ultimate judges of good and evil within   
their world, they are able to use these universal tendencies toward   
guilt and shame as emotional levers for their controlling and manip-   
ulative influences. They become the arbiters of existential guilt,   
authorities without limit in dealing with others' limitations. And   
their power is nowhere more evident than in their capacity to "for-   
give." 6   
  
IDEOLOGICAL TOTALISM   
  
The individual thus comes to apply the same totalist polarization   
of good and evil to his judgments of his own character: he tends to   
imbue certain aspects of himself with excessive virtue, and con-   
demn even more excessively other personal qualities — all according   
to their ideological standing. He must also look upon his impurities   
as originating from outside influences — that is, from the ever-   
threatening world beyond the closed, totalist ken. Therefore, one of   
his best ways to relieve himself of some of his burden of guilt is to   
denounce, continuously and hostilely, these same outside influences.   
The more guilty he feels, the greater his hatred, and the more   
threatening they seem. In this manner, the universal psychological   
tendency toward "projection" is nourished and institutionalized,   
leading to mass hatreds, purges of heretics, and to political and   
religious holy wars. Moreover, once an individual person has ex-   
perienced the totalist polarization of good and evil, he has great   
difficulty in regaining a more balanced inner sensitivity to the   
complexities of human morality. For there is no emotional bondage   
greater than that of the man whose entire guilt potential — neurotic   
and existential — has become the property of ideological totalists.   
  
The Cult of Confession   
  
Closely related to the demand for absolute purity is an obsession   
with personal confession. Confession is carried beyond its ordinary   
religious, legal, and therapeutic expressions to the point of becoming   
a cult in itself. There is the demand that one confess to crimes one   
has not committed, to sinfulness that is artificially induced, in the   
name of a cure that is arbitrarily imposed. Such demands are made   
possible not only by the ubiquitous human tendencies toward guilt   
and shame but also by the need to give expression to these tend-   
encies. In totalist hands, confession becomes a means of exploiting,   
rather than offering solace for, these vulnerabilities.   
  
The totalist confession takes on a number of special meanings.   
It is first a vehicle for the kind of personal purification which we   
have just discussed, a means of maintaining a perpetual inner empty-   
ing or psychological purge of impurity; this purging milieu enhances   
the totalists' hold upon existential guilt. Second, it is an act of   
symbolic self-surrender, the expression of the merging of individual   

----------------------- Page 359-----------------------

and environment. Third, it is a means of maintaining an ethos of   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
total exposure — a policy of making public (or at least known to   
the Organization) everything possible about the life experiences,   
thoughts, and passions of each individual, and especially those ele-   
ments which might be regarded as derogatory.   
  
The assumption underlying total exposure (besides those which   
relate to the demand for purity) is the environment's claim to total   
ownership of each individual self within it. Private ownership of   
the mind and its products — of imagination or of memory — becomes   
highly immoral. The accompanying rationale (or rationalization) is   
familiar to us (from George Chen's experience); the milieu has at-   
tained such a perfect state of enlightenment that any individual   
retention of ideas or emotions has become anachronistic.   
  
The cult of confession can offer the individual person meaning-   
ful psychological satisfactions in the continuing opportunity for   
emotional catharsis and for relief of suppressed guilt feelings, es-   
pecially insofar as these are associated with self-punitive tendencies   
to get pleasure from personal degradation. More than this, the   
sharing of confession enthusiasms can create an orgiastic sense   
of "oneness," of the most intense intimacy with fellow confessors   
and of the dissolution of self into the great flow of the Movement.   
And there is also, at least initially, the possibility of genuine self-   
revelation and of self-betterment through the recognition that "the   
thing that has been exposed is what I am." 9   
  
But as totalist pressures turn confession into recurrent command   
performances, the element of histrionic public display takes pre-   
cedence over genuine inner experience. Each man becomes con-   
cerned with the effectiveness of his personal performance, and this   
performance sometimes comes to serve the function of evading the   
very emotions and ideas about which one feels most guilty— con-   
firming the statement by one of Camus' characters that "authors of   
confessions write especially to avoid confessing, to tell nothing of   
what they know." 7 The difficulty, of course, lies in the inevitable   
confusion which takes place between the actor's method and his   
separate personal reality, between the performer and the "real me."   
  
In this sense, the cult of confession has effects quite the reverse   
of its ideal of total exposure: rather than eliminating personal se-   
crets, it increases and intensifies them. In any situation the personal   
secret has two important elements: first, guilty and shameful ideas   
which one wishes to suppress in order to prevent their becoming   
  
IDEOLOGICAL TOTALISM 427   
  
known by others or their becoming too prominent in one's own   
awareness; and second, representations of parts of oneself too pre-   

----------------------- Page 360-----------------------

cious to be expressed except when alone or when involved in special   
loving relationships formed around this shared secret world. Per-   
sonal secrets are always maintained in opposition to inner pressures   
toward self-exposure. The totalist milieu makes contact with these   
inner pressures through its own obsession with the expose" and the   
unmasking process. As a result old secrets are revived and new   
ones proliferate; the latter frequently consist of resentments to-   
ward or doubts about the Movement, or else are related to aspects   
of identity still existing outside of the prescribed ideological sphere.   
Each person becomes caught up in a continuous conflict over which   
secrets to preserve and which to surrender, over ways to reveal lesser   
secrets in order to protect more important ones; his own boundaries   
between the secret and the known, between the public and the   
private, become blurred. And around one secret, or a complex of   
secrets, there may revolve (as we saw with Hu) an ultimate inner   
struggle between resistance and self-surrender.   
  
Finally, the cult of confession makes it virtually impossible   
to attain a reasonable balance between worth and humility. The   
enthusiastic and aggressive confessor becomes like Camus' char-   
acter whose perpetual confession is his means of judging others:   
"[I] . . . practice the profession of penitent to be able to end up   
as a judge . . . the more I accuse myself, the more I have a right   
to judge you." The identity of the "judge-penitent" 8 thus becomes   
a vehicle for taking on some of the environment's arrogance and   
sense of omnipotence. Yet even this shared omnipotence cannot   
protect him from the opposite (but not unrelated) feelings of   
humiliation and weakness, feelings especially prevalent among those   
who remain more the enforced penitent than the all-powerful judge.   
  
The "Sacred Science"   
  
The totalist milieu maintains an aura of sacredness around its   
basic dogma, holding it out as an ultimate moral vision for the or-   
dering of human existence. This sacredness is evident in the pro-   
hibition (whether or not explicit) against the questioning of basic   
assumptions, and in the reverence which is demanded for the   
originators of the Word, the present bearers of the Word, and the   
  
428 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
Word itself. While thus transcending ordinary concerns of logic,   
however, the milieu at the same time makes an exaggerated claim   
of airtight logic, of absolute "scientific" precision. Thus the ultimate   
moral vision becomes an ultimate science; and the man who dares   
to criticize it, or to harbor even unspoken alternative ideas, becomes   
not only immoral and irreverent, but also "unscientific." In this   
way, the philosopher kings of modern ideological totalism reinforce   
their authority by claiming to share in the rich and respected her-   
itage of natural science.   
  
The assumption here is not so much that man can be God,   

----------------------- Page 361-----------------------

but rather that man's ideas can be God: that an absolute science of   
ideas (and implicitly, an absolute science of man) exists, or is at   
least very close to being attained; that this science can be combined   
with an equally absolute body of moral principles; and that the   
resulting doctrine is true for all men at all times. Although no   
ideology goes quite this far in overt statement, such assumptions   
are implicit in totalist practice. 9   
  
At the level of the individual, the totalist sacred science can   
offer much comfort and security. Its appeal lies in its seeming   
unification of the mystical and the logical modes of experience (in   
psychoanalytic terms, of the primary and secondary thought proc-   
esses). For within the framework of the sacred science, there is   
room for both careful step-by-step syllogism, and sweeping, non-   
rational "insights." Since the distinction between the logical and   
the mystical is, to begin with, artificial and man-made, an oppor-   
tunity for transcending it can create an extremely intense feeling of   
truth. But the posture of unquestioning faith — both rationally and   
nonrationally derived — is not easy to sustain, especially if one dis-   
covers that the world of experience is not nearly as absolute as   
the sacred science claims it to be.   
  
Yet so strong a hold can the sacred science achieve over his   
mental processes that if one begins to feel himself attracted to   
ideas which either contradict or ignore it, he may become guilty and   
afraid. His quest for knowledge is consequently hampered, since   
in the name of science he is prevented from engaging in the recep-   
tive search for truth which characterizes the genuinely scientific ap-   
proach. And his position is made more difficult by the absence, in   
a totalist environment, of any distinction between the sacred and   
the profane: there is no thought or action which cannot be related   
  
IDEOLOGICAL TOTALISM 429   
  
to the sacred science. To be sure, one can usually find areas of   
experience outside its immediate authority; but during periods of   
maximum totalist activity (like thought reform) any such areas   
are cut off, and there is virtually no escape from the milieu's ever-   
pressing edicts and demands. Whatever combination of continued   
adherence, inner resistance, or compromise co-existence the in-   
dividual person adopts toward this blend of counterfeit science and   
back-door religion, it represents another continuous pressure toward   
personal closure, toward avoiding, rather than grappling with, the   
kinds of knowledge and experience necessary for genuine self-ex-   
pression and for creative development.   
  
Loading the Language   
  
The language of the totalist environment is characterized by   
the thought-terminating cliche. The most far-reaching and complex   
of human problems are compressed into brief, highly reductive,   
definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed.   

----------------------- Page 362-----------------------

These become the start and finish of any ideological analysis. In   
thought reform, for instance, the phrase "bourgeois mentality" is   
used to encompass and critically dismiss ordinarily troublesome con-   
cerns like the quest for individual expression, the exploration of al-   
ternative ideas, and the search for perspective and balance in politi-   
cal judgments. And in addition to their function as interpretive   
shortcuts, these cliches become what Richard Weaver has called   
"ultimate terms": either "god terms," representative of ultimate   
good; or "devil terms," representative of ultimate evil. In thought   
reform, "progress," "progressive," "liberation," "proletarian stand-   
points" and "the dialectic of history" fall into the former category;   
"capitalist," "imperialist," "exploiting classes," and "bourgeois"   
(mentality, liberalism, morality, superstition, greed) of course fall   
into the latter. 10 Totalist language, then, is repetitiously centered   
on all-encompassing jargon, prematurely abstract, highly categori-   
cal, relentlessly judging, and to anyone but its most devoted ad-   
vocate, deadly dull: in Lionel Trilling's phrase, "the language of   
nonthought."   
  
To be sure, this kind of language exists to some degree within   
any cultural or organizational group, and all systems of belief de-   
pend upon it. It is in part an expression of unity and exclusiveness:   
  
430 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
as Edward Sapir put it, " 'He talks like us' is equivalent to saying   
'He is one of us'."  11 The loading is much more extreme in ideologi-   
cal totalism, however, since the jargon expresses the claimed cer-   
titudes of the sacred science. Also involved is an underlying assump-   
tion that language — like all other human products — can be owned   
and operated by the Movement. No compunctions are felt about   
manipulating or loading it in any fashion; the only consideration is   
its usefulness to the cause.   
  
For an individual person, the effect of the language of ideological   
totalism can be summed up in one word: constriction. He is, so   
to speak, linguistically deprived; and since language is so central   
to all human experience, his capacities for thinking and feeling are   
immensely narrowed. This is what Hu meant when he said, "using   
the same pattern of words for so long . . . you feel chained." Ac-   
tually, not everyone exposed feels chained, but in effect every-   
one is profoundly confined by these verbal fetters. As in other as-   
pects of totalism, this loading may provide an initial sense of in-   
sight and security, eventually followed by uneasiness. This uneasiness   
may result in a retreat into a rigid orthodoxy in which an individ-   
ual shouts the ideological jargon all the louder in order to demon-   
strate his conformity, hide his own dilemma and his despair, and   
protect himself from the fear and guilt he would feel should he at-   
tempt to use words and phrases other than the correct ones. Or   
else he may adopt a complex pattern of inner division, and dutifully   
produce the expected cliches in public performances while in his   
private moments he searches for more meaningful avenues of ex-   

----------------------- Page 363-----------------------

pression. Either way, his imagination becomes increasingly dis-   
sociated from his actual life experiences and may even tend to   
atrophy from disuse.   
  
Doctrine Over Person   
  
This sterile language reflects another characteristic feature of   
ideological totalism: the subordination of human experience to the   
claims of doctrine. This primacy of doctrine over person is evident   
in the continual shift between experience itself and the highly   
abstract interpretation of such experience — between genuine feelings   
and spurious cataloguing of feelings. It has much to do with the   
peculiar aura of half-reality which a totalist environment seems, at   
  
IDEOLOGICAL TOTALISM 43I   
  
least to the outsider, to possess.   
  
This tendency in the totalist approach to broad historical events   
was described in relationship to Chinese Communism by John K.   
Fairbank and Mary C. Wright:   
  
. . . stock characters like capitalist imperialists from abroad, feudal and   
semi-feudal reaction at home, and the resistance and liberation move-   
ments of "the people" enact a morality play. This melodrama sees ag-   
gression, injustice, exploitation, and humiliation engulf the Chinese peo-   
ple until salvation comes at last with Communism. Mass revolutions re-   
quire an historical myth as part of their black and white morality, and   
this is the ideological myth of one of the great revolutions of world his-   
tory. 12   
  
The inspiriting force of such myths cannot be denied; nor can one   
ignore their capacity for mischief. For when the myth becomes   
fused with the totalist sacred science, the resulting "logic" can be   
so compelling and coercive that it simply replaces the realities of   
individual experience. Consequently, past historical events are   
retrospectively altered, wholly rewritten, or ignored, to make them   
consistent with the doctrinal logic. This alteration becomes es-   
pecially malignant when its distortions are imposed upon individ-   
ual memory as occurred in the false confessions extracted during   
thought reform (most graphically Father Luca's).   
  
The same doctrinal primacy prevails in the totalist approach   
to changing people: the demand that character and identity be   
reshaped, not in accordance with one's special nature or poten-   
tialities, but rather to fit the rigid contours of the doctrinal mold.   
The human is thus subjugated to the ahuman. And in this manner,   
the totalists, as Camus phrases it, "put an abstract idea above hu-   
man life, even if they call it history, to which they themselves have   
submitted in advance and to which they will decide quite arbitrarily,   
to submit everyone else as well." 13   
  

----------------------- Page 364-----------------------

The underlying assumption is that the doctrine — including its   
mythological elements — is ultimately more valid, true, and real   
than is any aspect of actual human character or human experience.   
Thus, even when circumstances require that a totalist movement   
follow a course of action in conflict with or outside of the doctrine,   
there exists what Benjamin Schwartz has described as a "will to   
orthodoxy" 14 which requires an elaborate facade of new rationaliza-   
tions designed to demonstrate the unerring consistency of the   
  
4J2 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
doctrine and the unfailing foresight which it provides. The public   
operation of this will to orthodoxy is seen in the Party's explanation   
of the Hundred Flowers Campaign. But its greater importance lies   
in more hidden manifestations, particularly the totalists' pattern   
of imposing their doctrine-dominated remolding upon people in   
order to seek confirmation of (and again, dispel their own doubts   
about) this same doctrine. Rather than modify the myth in ac-   
cordance with experience, the will to orthodoxy requires instead that   
men be modified in order to reaffirm the myth. Thus, much of prison   
thought reform was devoted to making the Westerner conform to   
the pure image of "evil imperialist," so that he could take his proper   
role in the Communist morality play of Chinese history.   
  
The individual person who finds himself under such doctrine-   
dominated pressure to change is thrust into an intense struggle   
with his own sense of integrity, a struggle which takes place in   
relation to polarized feelings of sincerity and insincerity. In a   
totalist environment, absolute "sincerity" is demanded; and the   
major criterion for sincerity is likely to be one's degree of doctrinal   
compliance — both in regard to belief and to direction of personal   
change. Yet there is always the possibility of retaining an alterna-   
tive version of sincerity (and of reality), the capacity to imagine a   
different kind of existence and another form of sincere commit-   
ment (as did Grace Wu when she thought, "the world could not   
be like this"). These alternative visions depend upon such things   
as the strength of previous identity, the penetration of the milieu   
by outside ideas, and the retained capacity for eventual individual   
renewal. The totalist environment, however, counters such "deviant"   
tendencies with the accusation that they stem entirely from personal   
"problems" ("thought problems" or "ideological problems") derived   
from untoward earlier ("bourgeois") influences. The outcome will   
depend largely upon how much genuine relevance the doctrine   
has for the individual emotional predicament. And even for those   
to whom it seems totally appealing, the exuberant sense of well-being   
it temporarily affords may be more a "delusion of wholeness" 15   
than an expression of true and lasting inner harmony.   
  
IDEOLOGICAL TOTALISM   
  
The Dispensing of Existence   
  

----------------------- Page 365-----------------------

The totalist environment draws a sharp line between those whose   
right to existence can be recognized, and those who possess no   
such right. In thought reform, as in Chinese Communist practice   
generally, the world is divided into the "people" (defined as "the   
working class, the peasant class, the petite bourgeoisie, and the na-   
tional bourgeoisie"), and the "reactionaries" or "lackeys of im-   
perialism" (defined as "the landlord class, the bureaucratic capitalist   
class, and the KMT reactionaries and their henchmen"). Mao Tse-   
tung makes the existential distinction between the two groups quite   
explicit:   
  
Under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party,   
these classes [the people] unite together to form their own state and   
elect their own government [so as to] carry out a dictatorship over the   
lackeys of imperialism. . . . These two aspects, namely, democracy   
among the people and dictatorship over the reactionaries, combine to   
form the people's democratic dictatorship .... to the hostile classes   
the state apparatus is the instrument of oppression. It is violent, and not   
"benevolent." . . . Our benevolence applies only to the people, and   
not to the reactionary acts of the reactionaries and reactionary classes   
outside the people. 16   
  
Being "outside the people," the reactionaries are presumably   
nonpeople. Under conditions of ideological totalism, in China and   
elsewhere, nonpeople have often been put to death, their execu-   
tioners then becoming guilty (in Camus' phrase) of "crimes of   
logic." But the thought reform process is one means by which non-   
people are permitted, through a change in attitude and personal   
character, to make themselves over into people. The most literal   
example of such dispensing of existence and nonexistence is to be   
found in the sentence given to certain political criminals: execution   
in two years' time, unless during that two-year period they have   
demonstrated genuine progress in their reform.   
  
In the light of this existential policy, the two different pronuncia-   
tions of the word people ("people" and "peepul") adopted by the   
European group described in Chapter 9 was more than just a practi-   
cal maneuver. It was a symbolic way to cut through the loaded   
totalist language and restore the word to its general meaning,   
  
434 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
thereby breaking down the imposed distinction between people   
and nonpeople. Since the Westerners involved were themselves   
clearly nonpeople theirs was an invention born of the negative status   
dispensed to them.   
  
Are not men presumptuous to appoint themselves the dispensers   
of human existence? Surely this is a flagrant expression of what the   
Greeks called hubris, of arrogant man making himself God. Yet one   
underlying assumption makes this arrogance mandatory: the con-   
viction that there is just one path to true existence, just one valid   

----------------------- Page 366-----------------------

mode of being, and that all others are perforce invalid and false.   
Totalists thus feel themselves compelled to destroy all possibilities   
of false existence as a means of furthering the great plan of true   
existence to which they are committed. Indeed, Mao's words sug-   
gest that all of thought reform can be viewed as a way to eradicate   
such allegedly false modes of existence — not only among the non-   
people, within whom they supposedly originate, but also among   
legitimate people allegedly contaminated by them.   
  
The [function of the] people's state is to protect the people. Only   
where there is the people's state, is it possible for the people to use dem-   
ocratic methods or a nationwide and all-round scale to educate and re-   
form themselves, to free themselves from the influence of reactionaries   
at home and abroad .... to unlearn the bad habits and ideas acquired   
from the old society and not to let themselves travel on the erroneous   
path pointed out by the reactionaries, but to continue to advance and   
develop towards a Socialist and Communist society accomplishing the   
historic mission of completely eliminating classes and advancing toward   
a universal fraternity. 17   
  
For the individual, the polar emotional conflict is the ultimate   
existential one of "being versus nothingness." He is likely to be   
drawn to a conversion experience, which he sees as the only means   
of attaining a path of existence for the future (as did George   
Chen). The totalist environment — even when it does not resort   
to physical abuse — thus stimulates in everyone a fear of extinction   
or annihilation much like the basic fear experienced by Western   
prisoners. A person can overcome this fear and find (in Martin   
Buber's term) "confirmation," not in his individual relationships,   
but only from the fount of all existence, the totalist Organization.   
Existence comes to depend upon creed (I believe, therefore I am),   
upon submission (I obey, therefore I am) and beyond these, upon   
  
IDEOLOGICAL TOTALISM 435   
  
a sense of total merger with the ideological movement. Ultimately   
of course one compromises and combines the totalist "confirmation"   
with independent elements of personal identity; but one is ever   
made aware that, should he stray too far along this "erroneous   
path," his right to existence may be withdrawn.   
  
The more clearly an environment expresses these eight psychologi-   
cal themes, the greater its resemblance to ideological totalism; and   
the more it utilizes such totalist devices to change people, the   
greater its resemblance to thought reform (or "brainwashing").   
But facile comparisons can be misleading. No milieu ever achieves   
complete totalism, and many relatively moderate environments   
show some signs of it. Moreover, totalism tends to be recurrent   
rather than continuous: in China, for instance, its fullest expression   
occurs during thought reform; it is less apparent during lulls in   
thought reform, although it is by no means absent. And like the   
"enthusiasm" with which it is often associated, totalism is more   

----------------------- Page 367-----------------------

apt to be present during the early phases of mass movements than   
later — Communist China in the 1950's was generally more totalist   
than Soviet Russia. But if totalism has at any time been prominent   
in a movement, there is always the possibility of its reappearance,   
even after long periods of relative moderation.   
  
Then too, some environments come perilously close to totalism   
but at the same time keep alternative paths open; this combina-   
tion can offer unusual opportunities for achieving intellectual and   
emotional depth. And even the most full-blown totalist milieu can   
provide (more or less despite itself) a valuable and enlarging life   
experience — if the man exposed has both the opportunity to leave   
the extreme environment and the inner capacity to absorb and make   
inner use of the totalist pressures (as did Father Vechten and Father   
Luca).   
  
Also, ideological totalism itself may offer a man an intense peak   
experience: a sense of transcending all that is ordinary and prosaic,   
of freeing himself from the encumbrances of human ambivalence,   
of entering a sphere of truth, reality, trust, and sincerity beyond   
any he had ever known or even imagined. But these peak experi-   
ences, the result as they are of external pressure, distortion, and   
threat, carry a great potential for rebound, and for equally intense   
opposition to the very things which initially seem so liberating. Such   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
imposed peak experiences 18 — as contrasted with those more freely   
and privately arrived at by great religious leaders and mystics —   
are essentially experiences of personal closure. Rather than stimu-   
lating greater receptivity and "openness to the world," they en-   
courage a backward step into some form of "embeddedness" — a   
retreat into doctrinal and organizational exclusiveness, and into   
all-or-nothing emotional patterns more characteristic (at least at   
this stage of human history) of the child than of the individuated   
adult. 19   
  
And if no peak experience occurs, ideological totalism does even   
greater violence to the human potential: it evokes destructive emo-   
tions, produces intellectual and psychological constrictions, and   
deprives men of all that is most subtle and imaginative — under   
the false promise of eliminating those very imperfections and   
ambivalences which help to define the human condition. This   
combination of personal closure, self-destructiveness, and hostility   
toward outsiders leads to the dangerous group excesses so characteris-   
tic of ideological totalism in any form. It also mobilizes extremist   
tendencies in those outsiders under attack, thus creating a vicious   
circle of totalism.   
  
What is the source of ideological totalism? How do these ex-   
tremist emotional patterns originate? These questions raise the   
most crucial and the most difficult of human problems. Behind   

----------------------- Page 368-----------------------

ideological totalism lies the ever-present human quest for the om-   
nipotent guide — for the supernatural force, political party, philo-   
sophical ideas, great leader, or precise science — that will bring ul-   
timate solidarity to all men and eliminate the terror of death and   
nothingness. This quest is evident in the mythologies, religions,   
and histories of all nations, as well as in every individual life. The   
degree of individual totalism involved depends greatly upon factors   
in one's personal history: early lack of trust, extreme environmental   
chaos, total domination by a parent or parent-representative, in-   
tolerable burdens of guilt, and severe crises of identity. Thus an   
early sense of confusion and dislocation, or an early experience of   
unusually intense family milieu control, can produce later a com-   
plete intolerance for confusion and dislocation, and a longing for   
the reinstatement of milieu control. But these things are in some   
measure part of every childhood experience; and therefore the po-   
tential for totalism is a continuum from which no one entirely es-   
  
IDEOLOGICAL TOTALISM 437   
  
capes, and in relationship to which no two people are exactly the   
same.   
  
It may be that the capacity for totalism is most fundamentally   
a product of human childhood itself, of the prolonged period of   
helplessness and dependency through which each of us must pass.   
Limited as he is, the infant has no choice but to imbue his first   
nurturing authorities — his parents — with an exaggerated omnip-   
otence, until the time he is himself capable of some degree of in-   
dependent action and judgment. And even as he develops into the   
child and the adolescent, he continues to require many of the all-   
or-none polarities of totalism as terms with which to define his in-   
tellectual, emotional, and moral worlds. Under favorable circum-   
stances (that is, when family and culture encourage individuation)   
these requirements can be replaced by more flexible and moderate   
tendencies; but they never entirely disappear.   
  
During adult life, individual totalism takes on new contours as   
it becomes associated with new ideological interests. It may become   
part of the configuration of personal emotions, messianic ideas, and   
organized mass movement which I have described as ideological   
totalism. When it does, we cannot speak of it as simply a form of   
regression. It is partly this, but it is also something more: a new   
form of adult embeddedness, originating in patterns of security-   
seeking carried over from childhood, but with qualities of ideas and   
aspirations that are specifically adult. During periods of cultural   
crisis and of rapid historical change, the totalist quest for the om-   
nipotent guide leads men to seek to become that guide.   
  
Totalism, then, is a widespread phenomenon, but it is not the   
only approach to re-education. We can best use our knowledge   
of it by applying its criteria to familiar processes in our own cul-   
tural tradition and in our own country.

CHAPTER   
  
APPROACHES TO RE-EDUCATION   
  
Throughout this book I have been discussing what   
Milton called "the bitter change of fierce extremes."   
This kind of discussion, especially when it is critical in tone, im-   
plies that there are alternative possibilities for human change less   
bitter and less extreme. By human change I mean those shifts and   
alterations in the sense of inner identity which occur within individ-   
uals during late adolescence and adult life. My concern in this   
chapter is with the great agencies of such change — educational,   
psychological, religious, and political — and with their resemblances   
to, and their possibilities for avoiding, ideological totalism.   
  
All these agencies make use of four general approaches to chang-   
ing people: coercion, exhortation, therapy, and realization. Ideologi-   
cal totalism utilizes all four, as this study of thought reform makes   
clear; but it leans most heavily upon the first two. The approaches,   
therefore, are by no means mutually exclusive; however, each con-   
veys a distinct message, a specific goal, and an appeal to a particular   
aspect of human nature.   
  
The message of coercion is: you must change and become what   
we tell you to become— or else. The threat embodied in the "or   
else" may be anything from death to social ostracism, any form of   
physical or emotional pain. The goal of naked coercion is to pro-   
duce a cowed and demoralized follower. It is directed at the most   
primitive of human emotions, and stimulates the desire to flee, or   
  
438   
  
APPROACHES TO RE-EDUCATION 439   
  
to fight back, to freeze in fear, or submit completely. A good ex-   
ample of the coercive approach to changing people was the Nazi   
concentration camp. There, as Bruno Bettelheim has described, 1   
the intent was "to break the prisoners as individuals and to change   
them into docile masses. . . . useful subjects of the Nazi state."   
Gestapo authorities made no effort to indoctrinate the inmates,   
and in fact treated them in an unprecedentedly cruel, sadistic, and   
degrading fashion. Yet it is significant that even under such con-   
ditions some ideological conversions occurred: some long-term   
prisoners eventually adopted Nazi views on Aryan racial supremacy   
and on the legitimacy of German expansionism — a literal expres-   
sion of the psychological mechanism of "identification with the   
aggressor." 2 In thought reform, coercion is greatest during the   
early stages of the prison process; but it is an essential ingredient   
of all varieties of thought reform and of all phases, however much   
it may temporarily be shunted to the background.   
  

----------------------- Page 370-----------------------

The message of the exhortative approach is: you should change   
— if you are a moral man — and become what we (in the name of   
a higher moral authority) tell you to become. Exhortation seeks to   
create converts and disciples, people who have been changed in   
accordance with the specific ideological convictions of the mentor.   
It appeals to the individual's wish to be a good man, or to become a   
better one; to pre-existing tendencies toward experiencing guilt   
and shame, including existential guilt. It is the method par excel-   
lence of religions and of pseudo-religious secular ideologies, both of   
which reinforce their moral appeal by their promise of reward,   
earthly or supernatural. Exhortation is, as I have already empha-   
sized, always extremely prominent in thought reform, and is per-   
haps the most prominent of thought reform's approaches.   
  
The message of the therapeutic approach is: you can change   
— from your sickly state, and find relief for your suffering — if you   
have a genuine urge to become healthy; and if you are willing   
to follow my (or our) method and guidance. Its goal is physical   
and emotional health (in the sense conveyed by the words hale   
and whole), freedom from incapacitating disease and defect. It   
makes its appeal to that part of a man that is most reasonable,   
healthful, health-seeking, and balanced. This has been the tra-   
ditional approach of the medical profession, and in the emotional   
sphere it is best exemplified by psychotherapy and psychoanalysis.   
  
44O THOUGHT REFORM   
  
But religious and secular ideologies also use this approach, or at   
least make claims on it. Thought reform is extravagant in its re-   
ferral to "illness," "health," and "cure," following Mao Tse-tung's   
original lead; this usage implies biological restoration, and places   
reformers in the role of social physicians.   
  
The message of realization is: you can change — in such a fashion   
that you will be able to express more fully your own potential —   
if you are willing to confront yourself with ideas and approaches   
which challenge your present ways of knowing and acting. Its   
goal is to produce a person who expresses his creative potential   
to the full, one who extends his faculties to their utmost in the   
effort to appreciate and produce at the highest level at which he is   
capable. Although this goal is closely related to that of the therapeu-   
tic approach, it is by no means the same; it may cause rather than   
relieve pain, and may promote within a person periods of incapacity   
alternating with creative peaks rather than a balanced continuity   
of health and strength. Each of the major agencies for change at   
times emphasizes the approach of realization; at other times, each   
strays from it. It has been an avowed ideal of such diverse groups   
as political forces associated with traditional liberalism; various   
psychoanalytic groups, 3 most recently those influenced by exis-   
tentialism; mystics of all major Eastern and Western religions and   
practicing Zen Buddhists; and educators influenced by the philos-   
ophy of John Dewey. Other historical variations are the Confucian   

----------------------- Page 371-----------------------

concept of self-cultivation, and the Greek notion of aretS — the view   
that life exists for the purpose of reaching the full expression of   
one's inborn capacity. 4 But the approach of realization is the most   
difficult of all to maintain: many have violated it even as they   
theoretically proclaimed it, and it is notorious for its quick mortality   
rate. Indeed, the very formation of an institution around it has too   
often signified the beginnings of its disappearance. Here thought   
reform's claim is frequently the bitterest of ironies, since totalism   
does more to stifle than to realize the human potential. Yet the   
claim is not entirely false, since sometimes, especially among the   
young, thought reform has been experienced as a pathway to self-   
realization.   
  
In practice, no one of these approaches ever appears in pure form   
(even the Nazi concentration camp must have been influenced   
by the exhortative spirit of the mass movement behind it), and   
  
APPROACHES TO RE-EDUCATION 441   
  
significant attempts at changing people usually embody elements   
of all four. There is, moreover, considerable overlapping among   
them, and distinguishing them can become difficult. Thought   
reform in particular shows the complexities of interplay between   
exhortation and coercion: the use of coercion to stimulate excessive   
guilt and shame so that these in turn create an inner exhortation;   
and the use of exhortation to stimulate negative conscience so power-   
ful that it becomes in effect a form of self-coercion. At its other   
end, exhortation merges with therapy, as therapy merges with re-   
alization. Yet these four approaches can and should be distinguished   
from one another in any attempt at re-education, if not as abso-   
lute alternatives, at least as predominant emotional tones.   
  
In discussing the broader agencies of change — education, psy-   
chiatry, religion, and politics — I shall make no attempt to list every   
possible similarity and dissimilarity with thought reform. Rather,   
I shall point up those aspects in each of these agencies which can   
be illuminated by our general study of totalism.   
  
Education and Re-education   
  
I can best introduce the subject of the relationship of educa-   
tion to thought reform and to ideological totalism by presenting   
the several points of view which emerged at a small faculty seminar   
held at an American girls' college. After I had described the   
thought reform process at a revolutionary university, a lively debate   
began among the participating teachers about the relevance of   
thought reform to practices at their own institution (which I shall   
call Arly College) .   
  
Professor A made a blunt accusation:   
  
I think we are doing the same thing. We are brainwashing the girls   

----------------------- Page 372-----------------------

here at Ally. When the girls arrive as freshmen, they are herded together,   
greeted by seniors and other students who help them and show them   
around so that when they get to a class they can be relaxed and they   
can listen. They can agree with what is said and then we can be sure   
they will not leave Arly and go home. Then they can settle down to   
learning how to become good Arly girls. ... In most of our classes,   
the teacher has a definite idea of what we expect, and will view the stu-   
dent's past as evil until the student comes to this idea. There is no   
difference at all.   
  
442 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
As I listened to Professor A's accusation (and self-accusation),   
I felt that she was taking her extreme stand partly for its shock   
value, partly because she wished to air her worst fears (and have   
them relieved), and partly to express a certain amount of hos-   
tility toward her profession. Her attitude was manifestly open-   
minded, but it was also intellectually inadequate. Impressed by the   
similarities, and unable to immediately fathom the differences, she   
had in effect concluded: education is "brainwashing."   
  
Her words did not go unchallenged. Professor B became visibly   
upset, and firmly disagreed:   
  
What we do is entirely different. The point is that at a revolutionary   
university they demand a specific product, and insist that everyone   
emerge as this. Here at Arly we do not care about such things. We do   
not care what the girls believe when they graduate. Our main concern   
is that they learn something from their college experience.   
  
Professor B compassionately defended an institution to which   
she was deeply committed, and in her emphasis on the "expected   
product," she made an important point. But the threat to her self-   
esteem, implicit in Professor A's comparison, led her to overstate   
her defense; for when the others questioned her more closely she   
admitted that as a serious educator she could not avoid caring   
about what her students believed and about what kind of young   
women they were encouraged to become during their college years.   
She was taking an equally simplistic intellectual position: namely,   
that good education has absolutely no connection with "brainwash-   
ing" (or with ideological totalism).   
  
A young professor of English, also troubled, but more wary of   
facile conclusions, restated the issue as a dilemma:   
  
Much of what we teach depends upon some kind of group agreement   
on standards of quality and truth of concepts. At the same time, one   
of our main troubles is getting people to speak up and offer criticisms   
of others' ideas based upon their own genuine opinions. . . . But just   
by simply saying that Shakespeare was the greatest poet in the English   
language — an assumption on which any English teacher would find   
widespread common agreement — and by then expecting the student to   

----------------------- Page 373-----------------------

hold this opinion, aren't we really indulging in the same kind of process   
as thought reform?   
  
APPROACHES TO RE-EDUCATION 443   
  
After considerable additional discussion, during which I men-   
tioned some of the features of ideological totalism, Professor C   
made a thoughtful attempt at resolution:   
  
Perhaps we can avoid this by holding our beliefs with a certain amount   
of tension . . . with an attitude that "I believe in this, but recognize   
that there can be other beliefs in opposition to it." In this way we can   
subject any belief which we hold to the tension or pressure of its own   
limitations and of other alternative beliefs.   
  
By neither denying the continuities with thought reform nor   
overstating them in nihilistic despair, but instead by facing them   
as an unavoidable paradox, Professor C opened the way to a more   
fundamental approach. He grasped the necessity for both commit-   
ment and flexibility in education, and especially the necessity for   
its inclusion of what Michael Polanyi has called "personal knowl-   
edge" — knowledge neither strictly objective nor strictly subjec-   
tive which demands active participation and responsibility on the   
part of the knower. 6   
  
Later, as I thought about these three positions, I realized that   
Professors A and B had gone astray largely because they were un-   
able to understand the relationship between education and re-ed-   
ucation. In the broadest sense, these amount to the same thing.   
For in the student's act of attaining knowledge, his previous pat-   
terns of identity as well as belief must be altered, however slightly.   
Every new idea or technique requires a complex rearrangement of   
what existed before. And this rearrangement is necessary from the   
moment of birth, since the infant begins not as a tabula rasa but   
as an organism with innate behavioral tendencies (whether we call   
these tendencies drives, instincts, or needs). Re-education is inevi-   
tably influenced by the attitudes and beliefs (personal and institu-   
tional) conveyed by the mentors who guide it, and thus has some-   
thing in common with thought reform. Professor A perceived some   
of this and was overwhelmed by her perception. Professor B had   
to deny both the relationship between education and re-education   
and the extent of the mentor's involvement in the educational   
process. Professor C was searching for a formulation which would   
account for the relationship between education and re-education,   
for the mentor's influence upon it, and also for his being himself   
  
444 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
bound by certain group standards; but he transcended these simi-   
larities by distinguishing between good educational practice and   
ideological totalism. His concept of tension in the educational proc-   
ess was thus an affirmative addition to the negative criteria of   

----------------------- Page 374-----------------------

ideological totalism described in the previous chapter.   
  
Any educational experience is a three-way interplay among stu-   
dent, mentor, and the ideas being taught — ideally it is an interplay   
of stimulating tension. Such tension includes the mentor's forceful   
presentation of ideas within the context of the cultural traditions   
in which they arose; his demand that each student permit himself   
to be challenged by these ideas; and his allowance for each stu-   
dent's individual relationship to the ideas. When this tension does   
not exist, education is apt either to move in the direction of totalism   
or else simply fail. If, for instance, the idea or the subject matter   
becomes so predominant that mentor and student come to see   
themselves as mere vehicles for it, education encounters the totalistic   
dangers of doctrine over person and of the implied claim of a sacred   
science. Either the student will be completely uninvolved, or else   
he will be coerced by seemingly mysterious ahuman forces. The   
same totalist trends are present when mentor and idea come to-   
gether in an incontestable, omnipotent combination which makes   
no provision for the student; also present in these circumstances   
are milieu control, mystical manipulation, and — depending upon   
the forms of discipleship which the mentor's individual and institu-   
tional character dictate — the possibility of the demand for absolute   
purity, the cult of confession, and the dispensing of existence.   
  
This situation might exist, for instance, in a graduate school   
department of, let us say, economics, sociology, or literature, domi-   
nated by a forceful, authoritarian department head who is a single-   
minded devotee of one particular doctrinal approach to his subject   
and who considers alternative views "erroneous," and "unscientific."   
His students' assigned reading matter would be limited to this "cor-   
rect" approach, except possibly for a few readings among "incor-   
rect" writers included for the sake of gathering ammunition with   
which to ridicule them; students would be unable to question the   
ultimate truth of the prescribed doctrine and approach; they would   
feel guilty, frightened, and ashamed if they began to suspect that   
a rival approach might be a better one; and each would be under   
great pressure to reshape his identity in such a way that it could   
  
APPROACHES TO RE-EDUCATION 445   
  
encompass the correct doctrine— especially those who might be   
seeking the good will of the department head in relation to their   
future careers. This is, of course, the educational situation which   
most closely approximates totalism, although the ultimate avail-   
ability of alternative life choices outside the correct doctrine does   
distinguish it from thought reform.   
  
Finally, at the opposite extreme is the teaching situation in which   
ideas are considered to have little importance and are presented   
(and are expected to be received) with minimal involvement on   
everyone's part. In these circumstances, a disinterested withdrawal   
on the part of both mentor and student occurs, or else a com-   

----------------------- Page 375-----------------------

pensatory overfocus on the student-mentor relationship, so that   
both become bogged down in a psychological morass which neither   
understands.   
  
In each of these imbalances within the three-way relationship,   
the student's intellectual growth and his quest for realization are   
both hampered.   
  
Three-way tension does not in any way imply absolute equality of   
mentor and student; on the contrary, it demands that the former   
accept the responsibility of his intellectually superior position,   
and that the latter surrender himself to the extent that he becomes   
receptive rather than refractory to what is being taught. Moreover,   
temporary discipleships and educational environments of near-to-   
talism (such as sometimes exist in Jesuit-run schools) offer distinct   
intellectual advantages if the student goes on from these to the   
world outside. Even relatively coercive institutional demands for   
a particular identity product — transmitted by faculty and advanced   
students through a number of well-defined hazing rituals — can pro-   
vide emotional benefits: strong identifications, the opportunity to   
test one's capacity for rebellion against respected authorities, and   
an experience of personal trial and initiation which, although pain-   
ful at the time, is nostalgically recalled forever after. Relatively   
coercive environments can come close enough to totalism to do   
their damage, especially at lower age levels (for instance, the British   
public schools described by George Orwell). 8 But in pluralistic   
societies, even the most extreme of these institutions see themselves   
as part of the individual's continuing educational process. They   
may try to influence him as much as possible during his stay; but   
it is assumed that he will go on to new ideas and different identities   
  
446 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
in the future. They become most harmful when they approach the   
totalist extreme of claiming to offer the student a single path of   
absolute perfection whose limits he is never to exceed.   
  
The alternative to totalism in education then is a liberalism based   
upon the three-way tension described above, a liberalism that   
in Lionel Trilling's words can recapture its "essential imagination   
of variousness and possibility," without losing the "awareness of   
complexity and difficulty." It is, as Trilling goes on to say, "a   
large tendency rather than a concise body of doctrine." 7 In this   
"tendency" there is a rejection of omnipotence on the part of the   
mentor even when the student seeks to thrust it upon him; and   
a balance between a vigorous presentation of available knowledge   
and the encouragement of those elements of the student's imagina-   
tion which may someday transcend that knowledge in new dis-   
covery.   
  
Psychological Re-education   
  

----------------------- Page 376-----------------------

Psychotherapy and psychoanalysis are forms of psychological re-   
education; but they focus less upon man's knowledge of the world   
about him than upon his understanding of his own self. Their   
concern with the most fundamental and the most hidden of human   
emotions adds a special depth to their re-educating efforts, and a   
special intensity to their influence. Their avoidance of totalism   
is therefore a matter of particular importance. 8   
  
The ethos of psychoanalysis and of its derived psychotherapies   
is in direct opposition to that of totalism. Indeed, its painstaking   
and sympathetic investigations of single human minds place it   
within the direct tradition of those Western intellectual currents   
which historically have done most to counter totalism: humanism,   
individualism, and free scientific inquiry. Because of its continuing   
concern for individual differences and for flexible personal develop-   
ment, it is not surprising that psychoanalytic work has never been   
permitted under totalitarianism (or political totalism). And psycho-   
analytically-derived insights, as I have attempted to suggest through-   
out this book, provide one of the best ways to counter totalism   
through shedding light on its manner of functioning.   
  
But in its organizational aspects, psychoanalysis — like every other   
revolutionary movement, whether scientific, political, or religious   
  
APPROACHES TO RE-EDUCATION 447   
  
— has had difficulty maintaining its initial liberating spirit; it has   
had its full share of bitter ideological controversy and schism. More-   
over, certain social and historical features of the psychoanalytic   
movement — its early struggle with the unusually strong hostilities   
stimulated by its "shocking" doctrines, the novelty and isolated   
intensity of its therapeutic relationship, the brilliant virtuosity and   
"grandiose one-sidedness" 9 of its originator, and the subsequent   
intellectual and emotional appeal of its doctrine among practi-   
tioners and patients to the point of sometimes substituting for   
religious or political beliefs — have given rise to special problems   
in relationship to its scientific pursuits. These problems, and espe-   
cially the effect they have on the psychoanalytic training situa-   
tion, have been commented on by many psychoanalysts. 10 I can   
add little to what has already been written except to place some   
of these issues in the perspective of this study of totalism.   
  
Psychoanalytic training is a form of personal re-education, in   
preparation for re-educating others. During his years of apprentice-   
ship the trainee develops three important identities. He becomes   
first a patient. Through his own free associations in the "faceless"   
encounter with his analyst, he comes to grips with previously buried   
emotions in a way that "can play havoc with ... his adjustments   
to the individuals close to him, who cannot for the life of them see   
why a person has to get sick in order to learn how to cure others." 11   
This training analysis is his means of gaining insight into and   
mastery over those psychological tendencies which might other-   

----------------------- Page 377-----------------------

wise interfere with his own therapeutic work. He is also a student.   
He attends seminars on psychoanalytic theory and technique,   
sees these principles demonstrated in his own analysis, and learns   
how to utilize them in the analyses he later conducts under the   
supervision of senior analysts. And he is a candidate. He seeks to   
qualify for membership in the local institute, and in the national   
and international psychoanalytic organizations — for eventual "con-   
firmation" as a psychoanalyst. Erikson has referred to this train-   
ing as "a new kind of asceticism," one that "demands a total and   
central personal involvement . . . which takes greater chances with   
the individual's relationship to himself . . . than any other pro-   
fessional training except monkhood." 12   
  
From the standpoint of the criteria for ideological totalism, we   
may raise the following additional questions: Does this combina-   
  
448 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
tion of personal therapy, professional instruction, and organiza-   
tional influence — all mediated by a single training institute — create   
a tendency toward milieu control? Does it cause the institute itself   
to become surrounded with a near-mystical aura? Do these circum-   
stances^ — especially the candidate's learning a scientific doctrine in   
connection with its therapeutic application to his own psychological   
distress — create an implicit demand for ideological purity? And do   
they raise the possibility that his analyst and his institute, by bring-   
ing about his "cure," will become (even if inadvertently) the ar-   
biters of his neurotic and existential guilt? Could the confession   
process of therapy in this way take on an extratherapeutic function   
of binding the candidate to the psychoanalytic movement, thereby   
making him hesitant to criticize its teaching? Is there sometimes   
a tendency, in the descriptive and reductive overemployment of a   
particular school's or institute's favorite technical terms, to load   
the language or to suggest a sacred science? Is there thus a danger   
of establishing (perhaps unconsciously on everyone's part) a pat-   
tern of intellectual conformity as a prerequisite for a successful   
training experience — or in other words, establishing a primacy of   
doctrine over person? And when questions of ideological difference   
influence decisions about who is to be recognized as a legitimate   
psychoanalyst, is there a tendency toward the dispensing of exist-   
ence?   
  
It is perhaps unnecessary to stress that the psychoanalytic train-   
ing procedure never approaches the totalist actualities of thought   
reform, and for this reason I raise questions about "tendencies"   
and "dangers." 18 Nor can the problems involved in preparing   
men and women for psychoanalytic work in a manner that offers   
maximum protection for future patients be ignored. Indeed, it may   
be that the psychoanalyst often requires something stronger than   
a working hypothesis — something closer to a dogma — as a combined   
protective shield and sorting mechanism for the extraordinary rush   
of emotions released by the psychoanalytic process. But psycho-   

----------------------- Page 378-----------------------

analysis is able to look critically at itself, to experiment, correct,   
and change. As early as 1937, Franz Alexander, then President of   
the American Psychoanalytic Association, warned against these   
dangers and urged that psychoanalysis divest itself of its own "move-   
ment"; 14 others subsequently have suggested diminishing the insti-   
tutes' power, 16 and dividing the therapeutic and didactic aspects   
  
APPROACHES TO RE-EDUCATION 449   
  
of the student's training so that they are no longer controlled by   
the same institute. 16 Studies of the training procedure are being   
conducted; and the general trend is toward a more "open" environ-   
ment, toward a better balance in the educational tension among   
doctrine, mentor, and student. Thus the sweeping accusation that   
"psychoanalysis is brainwashing" is as false as the statement that   
"education is brainwashing." Insofar as tendencies toward totalism   
exist, however, they are bound to interfere with intellectual prog-   
ress, and with the emergence of those creative spirits which any   
discipline requires if it is to continue to contribute to the stream   
of human thought.   
  
I shall mention briefly just a few more of the many implications   
of this study of thought reform for the theory and practice of psy-   
chiatric re-education. The first pertains to the concept of "resist-   
ance," which is basic to most psychotherapy. Since thought reform   
has its own notion of "resistance," the caricatured exaggerations   
of ideological totalism can be helpful in examining some of the   
presuppositions of more moderate and more genuinely therapeutic   
work. Chinese reformers are apt to consider any inner opposition   
or outer hesitation — in fact anything at all that stands in the   
way of thought reform — as "resistance." The psychotherapist sim-   
ilarly regards almost any attitude or behavior standing in the way   
of cure — but especially the reluctance to bring unconscious ideas   
into consciousness — to be expressions of resistance to therapy. These   
resistances are the real experience of any therapist; but after a study   
of thought reform one cannot help but be a bit chastened in the use   
of the concept. That is, as a psychotherapist I would consider it   
important to ask myself whether what appears to be resistance is   
truly a reflection of inner opposition to cure, or whether it might   
be inner opposition to my concept of the necessary direction of   
cure. And I would also wonder whether such resistance might not   
be a reflection of poor communication between the patient and   
myself, or of the absence between us of shared values 17 and assump-   
tions about the therapy, both of which might be profitably in-   
vestigated along with any psychological barriers within the patient.   
  
The psychoanalytic concept of "transference" — a concept which   
is constantly being studied and reformulated — may also be re-   
examined in the light of questions of totalism. The therapist's   
  
45° THOUGHT REFORM   
  

----------------------- Page 379-----------------------

recognition of the existence of transference — that is, of the patient's   
tendency to re-experience, in relationship to the therapist, earlier   
attitudes and fantasies developed originally toward parental authori-   
ties — is on the whole an extremely important check against to-   
talism. For it provides a theoretical framework within which   
any tendencies in the patient to grant omnipotence to the therapist   
can be questioned by both, as well as a means of inquiring thera-   
peutically into the sources of such tendencies, and a rationale for   
resolving these emotions — however difficult a task this resolution   
may be. In thought reform an opposite policy prevails. Transfer-   
ence occurs there too, not so much in relationship to one "therapist"   
as to the entire ideological movement; but instead of attempting   
to understand and ultimately resolve this transference, the reformers   
seek to enlarge and perpetuate it in the participant's permanent   
surrender of self to the authoritarian organization.   
  
Like many other useful concepts, however, the notion of trans-   
ference, if it is overemphasized, can produce the very results against   
which it ordinarily guards. Thus, if the therapeutic relationship is   
viewed as exclusively one of transference — with the actual person of   
the therapist and the adult self of the patient ignored — the danger   
arises that the patient will come to see himself almost entirely   
within his infant-child identity, and that his bestowal of omnipo-   
tence upon the therapist will be inadvertently encouraged. Psycho-   
analysts have recognized this problem and have emphasized the   
necessary dialectic in every therapeutic relationship between actual   
encounter and transference, as well as the inevitability of the   
therapist's own emotional involvement (or countertransference   
reactions). 18 Especially relevant is Janet Mackenzie Rioch's con-   
cern 19 that the psychotherapist do all possible to offset rather than   
perpetuate the patient's frequent "willingness to surrender," and   
that he take cognizance of the "symbolically submissive position"   
inherent in the psychoanalytic treatment situation. Her warning to   
the analyst to avoid the role of the "chronic hypnotist" amounts to   
a warning against totalism — since hypnosis is in effect a situation of   
interpersonal totalism in which the subject's perceptual world is   
reduced to the highly-focused influence of the omnipotent hyp-   
notist. 20   
  
Another important issue which thought reform raises for psy-   
chiatric therapy is the use of the concept of "reality." The totalist   
  
APPROACHES TO RE-EDUCATION 45 1   
  
environment (in a Chinese prison, for instance) can literally stand   
reality on its head: demand that all within its sway commit them-   
selves to altered versions of external events, and then insist that   
these falsehoods constitute "objective reality." Psychiatrists are   
familiar with distortions like these, but arising in the minds of in-   
dividuals rather than resulting from group manipulations; and as   
psychiatrists we consider them signs of mental illness, thereby imply-   
ing that we expect psychologically healthy people to be able to   

----------------------- Page 380-----------------------

adhere to a reality of external events. We also recognize the great   
variation in interpretations of reality, especially in relationship to   
the "psychological realities" of individual patients. And we extend   
the concept of reality to suggest something on the order of the way   
things are, as opposed to the way that the patient imagines them   
to be. In fact, we regard the therapeutic relationship as a means of   
enhancing the patient's reality-testing, of helping him to recognize   
his own distortions.   
  
All of these usages have validity; but the therapist's notion of   
reality is nonetheless highly colored by his own ideological convic-   
tions about such matters as psychological health and illness, social   
conformity and rebelliousness, commitment and detachment, and   
especially about what constitutes wise or mature attitudes and be-   
havior. Moreover, it is precisely these issues — and their relationship   
to problems of personal identity — which trouble patients in psycho-   
therapy in America today, rather than the more clear-cut symptom   
neuroses described during the earlier days of psychoanalysis. This   
means consequently that unless the therapist can sort out his own   
reality prejudices, he may inadvertently transmit his personal   
ideologies within the treatment situation and require a successful   
implant upon the patient as a criterion for cure. Since ideological   
convictions about all of these matters are never absent, and indeed   
are necessary for any constructive change in therapy, they are   
better openly discussed as a part of the therapeutic process, and   
discussed in a manner that allows for their subjectivity and tenta-   
tiveness. To do this requires the view that reality is both definite   
(in relationship to external events), and highly relative (in relation-   
ship to any observer's interpretation of such events).   
  
Concerning milieu therapy, I have already mentioned thought   
reform's demonstration of the tremendous influence which a partic-   
ular milieu — and the psychological themes contained therein — can   
  
452 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
bring to bear upon the individual person. This has great importance   
for psychiatric practice in a variety of ways, but I shall limit myself   
here to mentioning the harmful effects of environments that are   
"extremist" in regard to the magnitude of stimuli which they offer.   
At one pole is the deprived milieu — the milieu of "sensory depriva-   
tion" 21 — in which stimuli are so sparse as to be insufficient for   
the maintenance within the individual person of a reasonable   
degree of interest in and responsiveness toward his surroundings.   
Such an environment has been created under experimental condi-   
tions, and it produces patterns of boredom, restlessness, stimulus-   
hunger, extensive day-dreaming, loss of organized thinking, hyno-   
gogic states, and a variety of hallucinatory experiences. The rough   
equivalent of a deprived milieu within a psychiatric environment is   
the old-fashioned back ward in which patients sat about (and un-   
fortunately still sit about) aimlessly, with little or no challenge or   
activity-evoking stimuli from their external surroundings. The op-   

----------------------- Page 381-----------------------

posite pole is the milieu of ideological totalism, in which the in-   
dividual is bombarded with stimuli to the point of suffocation. The   
counterpart of this kind of environment within a psychiatric hos-   
pital would be (again speaking very roughly) the "total push" ap-   
proaches adopted during the recent past by many institutions as   
a reaction against the stagnancy of the back wards atmosphere.   
While this was a definite improvement, it sometimes led to ac-   
tivity for activity's sake; a revealing comment on this was made to   
me by a schizophrenic patient after a few weeks' exposure to total   
push: "Gee, Doc, I wish I had a minute to sit down and think."   
  
There is a certain similarity in these two types of extreme en-   
vironments: both are overcontrolled milieux, and both interfere   
with the variety and balance of environmental stimuli required for   
optimal psychological function. Both are thus ultimately "de-   
prived," although we cannot say (as has sometimes been suggested)   
that the milieu of sensory deprivation is an experimental model   
for thought reform.   
  
Psychiatric hospitals have learned to avoid both extremes, and to   
develop programs and activities which offer a better balance between   
individual and milieu, so that the patient is neither overwhelmed by   
external stimuli nor so cut off from them that he is thrown back   
entirely upon his already malfunctioning internal life. Recent   
workers have stressed both socialization and individual creativity,   
  
APPROACHES TO RE-EDUCATION 453   
  
the increase of "open" (unlocked) wards, and the therapeutic com-   
munity. They have ad"ocated patient participation in the planning   
of hospital programs, a balance between ordered and spontaneous   
activities, and finally, an avoidance of the identity of permanent   
patienthood through emphasizing the patient's connections with   
and educational preparation for — rather than his medical isolation   
from — the outside world. 22   
  
Finally, thought reform also has sobering implications for psy-   
chiatric theory. Despite contrivances and crudities, Chinese Com-   
munist theory about the "class character of man" was made opera-   
tive and — at least to a certain extent — could be shown to "work."   
Theories have an irrepressible tendency to confirm themselves,   
especially when one deals with human beings; in Alfred North   
Whitehead's phrase, "the idea is a prophecy which procures its   
own fulfillment." This does not mean that we need despair and   
give up theorizing entirely (I certainly have shown no such tend-   
ency in this book); but it does suggest that psychiatrists can learn   
from physical scientists to look on theory not as a permanent and   
unalterable structure but rather as a useful and relatively valid   
means of ordering the data of experience within the framework of   
existing knowledge. Everyone of course recognizes this about   
theory — except when it comes to his theoretical beliefs.   
  

----------------------- Page 382-----------------------

Similarly, thought reform should make us somewhat cautious   
about those claims to "unification" of the behavioral sciences which   
imply an ultimate monopoly of one approach or an ultimate ideal   
of incontrovertible truth. A plunge into this kind of theoretical   
closure would be but another example of an intolerance for con-   
fusion driving us into the seductive embrace of totalism. I do not   
suggest that we can afford to rest content or cease being critical of   
faulty and ill-conceived theory and research; nor is there any doubt   
about our need for greater unity in our knowledge of man. But   
thought reform illustrates (and scientific experience strongly af-   
firms) the importance of remaining open to knowledge from all   
sources, even (or especially) the most unlikely. I am convinced that   
we need new approaches to psychiatric theorizing based upon   
humanized notions of style, pattern, and configuration in the inter-   
play of internal and external psychological forces, rather than upon   
the more simplistic cause-and-effect mechanical images of nine-   
teenth-century physics now so widely employed. Such new ap-   
  
454 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
proaches seem to be necessary if we are to learn more about the   
nature of man's emotional involvement in his changing physical   
environment, the ways in which he is himself undergoing change,   
and the relationship of this change to psychological health and   
disease, and to the realization of human potentialities. They will   
require outlooks which are the very antithesis of totalism: a subtle   
and flexible historical perspective beyond that of the individual life-   
history, a certain degree of boldness in the application of dis-   
ciplined imagination, and a willingness to risk being wrong — or to   
expose (in Riesman's term) the "nerve of failure."   
  
Religion, Political Religion, and Science   
  
I have already suggested that thought reform bears many re-   
semblances to practices of organized religion, and to various kinds   
of religious re-education. Indeed, most of the psychological themes   
of ideological totalism can be found somewhere in the Judeo-   
Christian tradition, however indirect any such theological in-   
fluences may have been in the development of thought reform   
itself. These totalist tendencies have usually been related either   
to the theocratic search for heresy or to patterns of revitalizing   
enthusiasm — or (as in thought reform) to both.   
  
In the first of these, the theocratic search for heresy, the in-   
evitable assumption is that the administrators — whether themselves   
secular or clerical — rule their community and carry out their ideo-   
logical purifications only as agents of a perfect and omniscient   
deity. The classical examples are the Inquisition of the middle ages   
and the treason and anti-Papist trials of sixteenth-century England.   
Both of these movements were characterized by orgies of false   
confessions, apparently produced by psychological manipulations   
of reality, identity, and guilt similar to those of thought reform.   

----------------------- Page 383-----------------------

Thus the Inquisition created its own witches, much as thought   
reform created its spies and reactionaries — this despite the fact that   
Inquisitors were specifically cautioned in one of their "technical   
manuals" (Malleus Maleficarum or Witches' Hammer) 23 against   
the undesirable possibility of producing false confessions. And   
prominent persons in Tudor England, impressed by "the brilliant   
aura of divinity, the inscrutable light of infallibility which emanated   
from the royal person" denounced themselves for crimes they had   
  
APPROACHES TO RE-EDUCATION 455   
  
never committed. 24 Chinese Confucianism (whether or not one   
considers it a religion) on the whole avoided such tendencies, al-   
though it too at times became sensitive to heresy and moved in   
the direction of totalism; for the most part it created something   
closer to what Whitehead has termed a "genial orthodoxy," and   
allowed a considerable amount of personal leeway within the limits   
of its unchallengeable assumptions (in this respect not unlike some   
phases of medieval Catholicism).   
  
The second variety of religious totalism, that associated with   
revitalizing enthusiasm, has been widespread enough: it can be   
found in the more extreme practices of early Lutheranism and   
Calvinism, 25 in the Chiliastic sects of the middle ages 26 and in   
many post-Reformation fundamentalist and revivalist cults. All of   
these movements, according to Ronald Knox, reflect the "over-   
mastering influence" of St. Augustine — even if "exaggerated now   
from this angle, now from that." 27 Usually laying great stress upon   
the dramatic personal conversion experience, while varying in their   
relative emphasis upon confession and re-education, they have   
sought to purify man in accordance with a particular vision of   
Biblical truth or prophecy; as in thought reform, this vision has   
sometimes been so urgent that men have been physically and   
psychologically brutalized in its name.   
  
Beyond these theological excesses, thought reform has a more   
fundamental relationship to religion in general, a relationship noted   
by almost every priest and minister who has come into contact with   
it. One Jesuit priest who was studying Chinese indoctrination   
methods in Hong Kong emphasized to me the following parallels   
with Christianity: the concept of love (of country, "the people,"   
labor, science, and public property); the concept of hope in the   
future (through the accomplishments of socialism); faith (in   
Communist ideology); a deity (the Communist movement); a   
spirit of martyrdom, of sacrifice and suffering, an aspiration to   
sainthood; stress upon humility and selflessness; and the stress upon   
converting theoretical principles into a way of life. (Many secular   
writers — Bertrand Russell, for instance — have made similar com-   
parisons.) Others among my subjects compared thought reform to   
their own Jesuit training, although they were usually quick to dis-   
tinguish the two on the basis of ultimate moral purpose. A Protes-   
tant missionary was struck by its similarity with the Moral Re-   

----------------------- Page 384-----------------------

  
456 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
armament movement in which he had at one time been active —   
especially in regard to such things as group manipulation of guilt   
and planned spontaneity. 28 One or two priests spoke of Com-   
munism as "nothing but a Christian heresy" — a statement which   
perhaps says both too much and too little; and few among my   
subjects, whatever their clerical or secular status, failed to comment   
upon the "religious" nature of thought reform's emotional in-   
tensities, moral energies, and exhortative demands.   
  
Keeping in mind thought reform's close relationship to religion,   
how can we distinguish totalist practice within religious institutions   
from more balanced forms of spirituality? Rhadakrishnan, the dis-   
tinguished Indian philosopher and statesman, points to organizing   
tendencies within religion as the specific danger:   
  
When religion becomes organized, man ceases to be free. It is not God   
that is worshipped but the group or the authority that claims to speak   
in His name. Sin becomes disobedience to authority and not violation   
of integrity. 29   
  
I believe we must consider also the prevailing themes within a   
particular religious milieu. Thus religious totalism can be recognized   
by the criteria outlined in Chapter 22, and especially by the fol-   
lowing trends: exaggerated control and manipulation of the in-   
dividual, the blanketing of the milieu with guilt and shame, the   
emphasis upon man's hopeless depravity and worthlessness, and   
upon his need to submit abjectly to a vengeful deity — all within the   
framework of an exclusive and closed system of ultimate truth.   
  
Contrasting with religious totalism are those religious situations   
which stress man's worth and his possibilities as well as his limita-   
tion; his capacity to change as well as the difficulties inherent in   
bringing about such change; and faith and commitment without   
the need for either self-negation or condemnation of nonbelievers.   
These attitudes leave room for emotional and intellectual growth   
as opposed to static doctrinal repetitions, and a broadened sensi-   
tivity to the world rather than a retreat into religious embeddedness.   
Since each of the world's major religions has at one time or an-   
other demonstrated both of these contrasting tendencies, any   
particular religious environment must be judged according to its   
own characteristics. 30   
  
Man is unlikely to give up his need for the sense of awe and devo-   
  
APPROACHES TO RE-EDUCATION 457   
  
tion inherent in the religious experience; but there are indications   
from many parts of the world that organized religion is playing a   
diminishing role in mediating human change. Religious institu-   

----------------------- Page 385-----------------------

tions, while highly influential, tend to assume a relatively conserva-   
tive stance, and political movements, as well as scientific and   
technological innovations, have become the great regulators of   
change. During the past century, emotions formerly directed toward   
organized religion have been expressed in relationship to politics   
and science. This rechanneling of emotion is not without its   
dangers; as Camus said, "Politics is not religion, or, if it is, then it   
is nothing but the Inquisition." 81 Such political inquisitions occur   
— as in thought reform — when ideological totalists set up their own   
theocratic search for heresy.   
  
One example of this variety of totalism in recent American   
history would be McCarthyism, a bizarre blend of political religion   
and extreme opportunism. True, this movement never developed   
the scope or the organization of a full-scale thought reform pro-   
gram, either during the lifetime of its leader or after his death;   
yet it had many uncomfortable resemblances, including most of the   
characteristics of ideological totalism. In particular: the "big ac-   
cusation" accompanied by "small facts" (like that described by   
Father Vechten); the quick development of a relationship of guilt   
between the accused and his environment, along with ruthless   
exploitation of ostracism and shame; a cult of confession and re-   
pentance; a stress upon self-betrayal and a bond of betrayal be-   
tween accusers and accused; the creation of a mythological doctrine   
(the State Department was being overrun by Communist "subver-   
sives" who were in turn responsible for "losing China"); and the   
demand that victims take on a new identity in accordance with this   
myth. The ostensible purpose of McCarthyism was of course that   
of fighting Communism; in the end, it not only did great service   
to Communism throughout the world, but also became a poor   
imitation of its declared enemy. Indeed, the focus of so much of   
McCarthyism's ideological mythology upon China seems more than   
coincidental. It suggests that the American emotional involvement   
in that country, based on years of missionary activity and wartime   
alliance, was so great, and the events of the Communist revolution   
so far-reaching and unpalatable, that the American public was   
receptive to a rewriting of history no less distorted than that of   
  
458 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
thought reform's own myth. And among those most actively en-   
gaged in the McCarthyist movement were many former Com-   
munists turned anti-Communist — all of which again seems to   
confirm (at varying levels of politics and individual emotion) the   
principle that totalism breeds totalism.   
  
But McCarthyism was not simply a reaction to Communism;   
it had close connections with specific religious and secular currents   
in American life. Edward Shils has convincingly demonstrated its   
relationship to religious fundamentalism and to the demagogic   
strain of political populism. 32 This relationship suggests that the   
political inquisition and its related totalist phenomena find fertile   

----------------------- Page 386-----------------------

soil in a wide variety of social and historical conditions and in   
virtually any culture. It also reveals the source of one of McCarthy-   
ism's fatal weaknesses — its antiscientific bias.   
  
As Shils points out, the McCarthyist harassment of scientists   
within and without the government was not only a reflection of its   
general mania concerning "security," but also of the fundamen-   
talist's long-standing distrust of the scientist, and of the dema-   
gogue's resentment of the intellectual. The thought reform move-   
ment also shows great distrust of the intellectual, but in contrast   
worships science and scientists. In these extreme attitudes we see   
a modern shift of the god-devil axis from religion to science.   
  
The god side of the axis (by no means confined to the Com-   
munist world) is expressed vividly by Michael Polanyi:   
  
. . . just as the three centuries following on the calling of the Apostles   
sufficed to establish Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Em-   
pire, so the three centuries after the founding of the Royal Society suf-   
ficed for science to establish itself as the supreme intellectual authority   
of the post-Christian age. "It is contrary to religion!" — the objection   
ruled supreme in the 17th century. "It is unscientific!" is its equivalent   
in the 20th. 33   
  
Accompanying this deification is the expectation that science will   
supply a complete and absolutely accurate mechanistic theory of a   
closed and totally predictable universe. Modern physics has long   
disowned this ideal, but it persists in the human sciences — bio-   
logical, psychological, and social — and is particularly damaging   
there. Thought reform is its ultimate expression — a mechanized   
  
APPROACHES TO RE-EDUCATION 459   
  
image of man within a closed society, and a claim to scientific   
method in the remaking of man in this image. There is the as-   
sumption that science — that is, the "social science" of Marxism —   
can liberate men from the encumbrances of all past institutions,   
family ties, social loyalties, professional affiliations, and religious   
and philosophical commitments: first by exposing these as "un-   
scientific," then by demonstrating that they are no longer necessary   
in a truly "scientific" environment. It is true that this faith in   
science can produce much that is humane and beneficial: a dis-   
tinguished British physician, for instance, after his return from a   
visit to China termed the Chinese Communist Party "probably the   
best instrument ever devised for cleaning up a slum, for instructing   
its inhabitants in hygiene and for getting everybody immunized." 34   
But men also require institutions and conventions of varying de-   
grees of rationality; and thought reform, rather than eliminating   
such institutions, has established new ones even more encompassing   
than the old, and a good deal more blinding in relationship to   
knowledge and truth.   
  

----------------------- Page 387-----------------------

While this god-pole of science seems now to predominate almost   
everywhere, it is possible that there lurks beneath it more of the   
devil-pole than might be suspected. For there are also suggestions   
(evident in many kinds of literature, including science fiction) of   
great hostility toward science, hostility beyond the fundamentalist   
prejudices of McCarthyism. Men resent the power of science to   
change familiar landscapes and to reshape the world in ways that   
make them feel less at home in it. Above all, they fear the destruc-   
tive power of science, its capacity to create weapons which could   
destroy mankind. Science becomes, if not a disguised devil, at   
least a vengeful god to be feared beyond all others, and people   
begin to believe that if only we could be rid of science and   
scientists the world would be left in peace. God-pole and devil-pole,   
equally misleading and dangerous in their extremism, may even   
exist concurrently within the same mind. 35   
  
There are more constructive approaches to science, and there are   
alternatives to the kinds of totalist imbalance we have described   
among science, politics, and religion. An extensive discussion of   
these would be beyond both the scope of this book and my personal   
capabilities; but I would like to indicate a few of the possibilities   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
which have been suggested by scientists themselves.   
  
Albert Einstein, for instance, stressed the need for an equilibrium   
between science and nonscientific tradition:   
  
. . . the 1 scientific method can teach us nothing else beyond how facts   
are related to, and conditioned by, each other . . . the aspiration toward   
such objective knowledge belongs to the highest of which man is capa-   
ble. . . . Yet it is equally clear that knowledge of what is does not open   
the door directly to what should be. . . . To make clear these funda-   
mental ends and valuations, and to set them fast in the emotional life   
of the individual, seems to me precisely the most important function   
which religion has to perform in the social life of man. And if one asks   
whence derives the authority of such fundamental ends, since they can-   
not be stated and justified merely by reason, one can only answer, they   
exist in a healthy society as powerful traditions, which act upon the   
conduct and the aspirations and judgments of individuals. 86   
  
Einstein does not claim for science the omnipotence which   
totalists bestow upon it, nor the authority to dictate or replace the   
full complex of ideals that men live by.   
  
Indeed, the greatest of scientists have frequently spoken of their   
own need for faith— or trust — in the order of the universe, of their   
awe and humility before it, of the inevitable incompleteness of   
their understanding of it. Thus, Robert Oppenheimer writes about   
his profession:   
  

----------------------- Page 388-----------------------

In it we learn, so frequently that we could almost become accustomed   
to it, how vast is the novelty of the world, and how much even the physi-   
cal world transcends in delicacy and in balance the limits of man's prior   
imaginings. We learn that views may be useful and inspiriting although   
they are not complete. We come to have a great caution in all assertions   
of totality, of finality or absoluteness. 37   
  
It seems clear that scientific practice should lead one to reject,   
rather than embrace, totalism of any variety. J. Bronowski carries   
this view further in his discussion of "the scientific spirit" as a   
mode of thinking, with its emphasis upon "the creative mind," the   
"leap of imagination," and the "habit of truth"; and its require-   
ment that "the society of scientists ... be a democracy [which]   
can keep alive and grow only by a constant tension between dissent   
and respect, between independence from the views of others and   
tolerance for them." 38   
  
APPROACHES TO RE-EDUCATION 461   
  
Science can advance greatly even in a totalitarian society, but   
it always requires a special enclave in which there exist speculative   
freedom and the "habit of truth." (Genuine science can serve as   
an escape from philistine sacred science and becomes in such a   
society one of the few professions in which unhindered creative   
work is possible. Indeed the attractions of this relatively free and   
highly-respected enclave within an over-controlled society are in-   
evitably felt by that society's most talented young men and women,   
and may have much to do with the impressive scientific progress   
which has taken place in Russia. )   
  
The ideas of Einstein, Oppenheimer, and Bronowski suggest   
the possibility of a society in which politics and science coexist   
neither in total isolation nor in suffocating embrace; in which   
political bodies help to guide scientifically-based change with sensi-   
tive concern for the simultaneous altering, elimination, and preser-   
vation of various traditional institutions; in which science itself is   
free to explore all aspects of the human and nonhuman realms,   
while actively resisting anyone's claim to a mechanized absolute:   
and above all, of a society supporting a variety of clerical and   
secular approaches to knowledge and to faith, no one of which is   
permitted to impose upon the others the threats and restrictions of   
self-acclaimed final truth.   
  
We need not dwell upon the difficulties of achieving such a   
vision, and during the last half-century the world has, if anything,   
moved further from it. Nor is the task made simpler by the dramatic   
transformations which science is helping to promote everywhere,   
the significance of which is baffling to nonscientists and by no   
means fully clear to scientists themselves. Yet this vision can provide   
not only an alternative to totalism but also an approach toward   
restoring a more favorable balance in the creative-destructive po-   
tential always inherent within this three-way interplay. If religion,   

----------------------- Page 389-----------------------

politics, and science can reach such an equilibrium, they will be-   
come less the objects of extremist emotions and more the rightful   
agents of three vital tendencies of individual mental life: spirituality,   
judiciousness, and the mastery of the unknown.    
  
CHAPTER   
  
OPEN" PERSONAL CHANGE   
  
Nontotalist approaches to re-education can encour-   
age an experience of individual change very different   
from that promoted by thought reform — one characterized by   
"openness to the world" rather than by personal closure. Not much   
has been written about the psychology of this open form of per-   
sonal change, and I will attempt only to suggest some of its features   
in relationship to the general problem of human change at this   
historical moment. I do so well aware of the difficulties involved   
both in formulating such change and in actually achieving it; yet   
it would seem to me less than responsible to conclude this study in   
any other way.   
  
Any statement about human change depends upon one's assump-   
tions concerning the extent to which adult and near-adult people   
can change. Chinese reformers seem to assume an extreme malle-   
ability of human character. They go far beyond conventional   
Marxist-Leninist approaches in their conviction that even those   
who have been exposed to the most pernicious influences of the   
"exploiting classes" can "change their class" and personally "turn   
over." They look upon human beings, at least implicitly, as wrongly-   
molded clay, needing only new molds and proper remolding from   
ideological potters — a remolding process which they themselves   
are willing to pursue with the hottest of fires and the most suf-   
focating of kilns. Theirs is the totalist vision of change, what J. L.   
  
462   
  
"open" personal change 463   
  
Talmon has called "the sustained and violent effort to make all   
things new." 1   
  
Psychiatric experience can support no such view. As psychiatrists,   
we are in fact constantly impressed with the enduring quality of   
emotional patterns developed during infancy and childhood, and   
with the difficulties involved in changing these. We are also struck   
by the importance of certain universals of emotional life — am-   
bivalent admixtures of love, hate, shame, guilt, striving, and de-   
pendency. These exist partly outside of conscious awareness, and   
none can be completely eliminated even by the dramatic type of   
change which thought reform proposes. It may be, however, that   
in psychiatry we err in the opposite direction, that we underesti-   
mate the possibilities for adult change. Thus some psychiatric   

----------------------- Page 390-----------------------

writing seems to express the ultra-conservative notion that there is   
nothing new under the sun, that man is so "determined" by his   
instincts and by the events of his childhood that all suggestion of   
later change is illusory.   
  
Recent work in the human sciences, however, suggests a middle   
ground, 2 and it is this approach I wish to pursue here. For I be-   
lieve that change during adult life is real and perpetual; significant   
change may be extremely difficult to consolidate, but the capacity   
to change significantly during adult life has become in this his-   
torical epoch increasingly necessary for emotional survival. Thus,   
in the individual subjects of this study, important changes occurred   
during late adolescence and adulthood, although impressively con-   
sistent behavioral patterns remained throughout their lives. And   
more universally, we find imaginative expression of this capacity to   
change in the great mythological theme of "death and rebirth," a   
theme given coercive expression in thought reform.   
  
I wish to describe in rough outline a pattern of personal change,   
another symbolic form of death and rebirth, parallel to but sig-   
nificantly different from that imposed by totalist practice. Such a   
change can occur through more or less formal association with   
education, religion, therapy, or politics; it can also take place   
through less structured encounter with new people, new ideas, or   
new landscapes. We may conveniently envision it within a three-   
step sequence: confrontation, reordering, and renewal.   
  
By confrontation I mean the combination of inner impulse and   
external challenge which creates within a person the simultaneous   
  
464 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
recognition of the need and the possibility for change. I stress the   
element of inner impulse because I believe that there is in man   
a fundamental urge toward change — a force which propels him in   
the direction of what is new and unknown — ever battling with his   
opposing tendency to cling exclusively to what is emotionally   
familiar. In this sense man is never simply "changed" by external   
forces, but rather finds his individual impulses toward change acti-   
vated and manipulated by these forces. Without such inner as-   
sistance from each individual person, the agencies of change could   
have little success, and little justification for their existence. Ex-   
ternal challenge is thus always related to internal urges to know   
and to master.   
  
This open confrontation causes a questioning of identity rather   
than thought reform's assault upon identity. It calls forth the   
most specifically human of faculties — introspection and symboliza-   
tion — rather than stunting these faculties by use of totalist coercion   
and dogma. The person so challenged is thrown back upon the re-   
sources derived from his own past without being thrust into thought   
reform's regressive stance. He experiences anxiety at the prospect of   

----------------------- Page 391-----------------------

emerging from the security of existing identities and beliefs, pos-   
sibly even the severe anxiety of potential nothingness, but not the   
sense of being annihilated by all-powerful manipulators of anxiety.   
He feels the guilt and shame of unfulfillment — the "shock of   
recognition" of neglected personal capacities — but without the   
virulent self-hatred demanded by the accusatory totalist milieu. He   
may experience a deep sense of inner and outer disharmony, of un-   
comfortable personal alienation, but not the antagonistic estrange-   
ment of thought reform. The rebel who undergoes "a feeling of   
revulsion at the infringement of his rights," 3 the prospective re-   
ligious convert who becomes aware of his "divided self," 4 the   
seeker of psychotherapy who comes to recognize the debilitating   
nature of his neurosis, the artist who feels himself drawn into a   
new creative realm, and the ordinary man who at some point   
questions the pattern of his existence — all of these are examples of   
confrontation.   
  
To act upon this confrontation is to advance to the next phase,   
that of reordering; and this means embarking upon the work of   
re-education and change. As in thought reform, reordering is likely   
to include a personal "emptying" process — some form of confession   
  
"open" personal change 465   
  
and exploration of existential guilt — in the service of exposing and   
altering past emotional patterns. But the personal exposure is   
dignified by privacy and balance; insights and interpretations are   
neither coercively publicized nor artificially guided along the nega-   
tive thought reform channels of self-betrayal and logical dishonor-   
ing. The involved individual cannot avoid the impact of his nega-   
tive identity, but he is not forced to view himself as nothing but this   
most debasing of self-images. In dealing with the harsh realities of his   
own limitations and of the world outside himself, he is by no means   
guaranteed a happy ending: he may indeed experience the terror   
and dread of a true sense of tragedy, but not the humiliating com-   
mand performance of thought reform's manipulated pseudo-tragedy.   
  
Symbolic emptying is accompanied by a corresponding absorp-   
tion of new or refashioned ideas and emotions; this absorption can   
be accomplished by relatively free learning rather than by the nar-   
row impositions of a sacred science. This learning requires a   
measure of personal isolation, and even a temporary refractoriness   
to alternative influences, but not the hermetic self-sealing of   
totalism. There is the opportunity to test the personal validity of   
new ideas, to experiment with new forms of human relationships   
and creative expression, rather than the demand that all of these   
be subjugated to prefabricated totalist ideology and language.   
Through emptying and absorption, the individual (as in thought   
reform) constantly reinterprets his own past. He cannot reinterpret   
without ideological bias, without a certain amount of emotional   
polarization and an overcritical attitude toward his past conditioned   
by his urge to change; but he can find ways to moderate his judg-   

----------------------- Page 392-----------------------

ments (through both introspection and outside influences), rather   
than having them further distorted by the always immoderate,   
guilt saturated totalist milieu.   
  
The third and final stage consists of a sense of open renewal,   
contrasting with thought reform's closed form of rebirth. Renewal   
depends upon the new alignment — the new sense of fit — between   
personal emotions and personally-held ideas about the world; in   
other words, on a new interplay between identity and ideology in   
which both have been changed. Through renewal, the individual can   
free himself from exaggerated dependencies and experience an   
"emergence from embeddedness" 8 rather than a plunge into a   
new form of totalist embeddedness. He can accomplish this only by   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
viewing his relationships to old authorities as steps along his per-   
sonal path toward greater independence, not by making the illusory   
totalist effort to annihilate their inner remnants or deny their   
existence.   
  
He is free to experience a new or reinforced commitment to an   
ideal or a cause, but a commitment made autonomously and   
in the face of alternatives, rather than as a compulsory loyalty as-   
sociated with a bond of betrayal. Instead of totalism's highly-   
simplified and distorted pure image approach to knowledge, he may   
acquire an enlarged receptivity to intellectual and emotional   
complexities around him. Nor can this renewal be consolidated by   
the symbolic submission of a "final confession" or a "final thought   
summary"; rather, there must be an awareness (whether gradual or   
sudden) of genuine self-knowledge and a readiness to accept its   
consequences. These include: a personal responsibility for expres-   
sions of love and hate, rather than a submission to their legislation   
by push-button enthusiasm or by ideological command; and a   
recognition of social identifications beyond the self — free of ideo-   
logical exclusiveness, and including yet transcending family, pro-   
fession, culture, and nation.   
  
A person so renewed, instead of being coercively reshaped ac-   
cording to an imposed ideological myth, will be able to call forth   
the "submerged metaphor" 6 of his own mythologically nourished   
imagination to further his efforts at self-expression. He will feel   
himself to be connected with his past, however critical he may be of   
it, and will not try, in the totalist manner, to cut himself off from it   
completely. This new harmony, however, cannot afford him total   
relief from personal conflict and confusion. A certain amount of   
conflict and confusion are in fact inherent in the enlarged life   
space which he attains, in contrast to their attempted elimination   
by totalist constriction. Such renewal, whether achieved through per-   
sonal search or by guided secular or clerical change, places one in   
more viable relationship to the universal human experience, or to   
"the principle of continuous life." 7   

----------------------- Page 393-----------------------

  
In contrasting this open style of change with the closed thought   
reform mode, I am admittedly speaking in ideal terms. No such   
change can proceed entirely unhindered, as closed-system emotional   
patterns always exist within any person — patterns of regression,   
  
"open" personal change   
  
mistrust, and of incapacitating dependency — which undermine   
open change at every turn. The three steps I have described are, of   
course, schematic, since each is likely to be incomplete and all   
three can occur simultaneously.   
  
Yet open change does occur and has been described. We can   
see it in the lives of great men: in, for instance, Camus' emer-   
gence from the "burning and disordered" years of his experiments   
with totalism (both Communism and nihilism) to become perhaps   
the most articulate moralist and exponent of autonomous com-   
mitment in our century. 8 We see it also in what William James   
described as the "willingness to be" of religious converts and the   
"states of knowledge" and "states of insight" of Eastern and   
Western mystics; 9 and in what Michael Balint calls the "new be-   
ginning of love" of successfully treated psychoanalytic patients. 10   
We have also observed change of this kind among the subjects of   
this study, in their casting off the closed influences of thought re-   
form and undergoing a personal experience of renewal (for example,   
Father Vechten, Father Luca, George Chen, and Mr. Hu). I   
would make the further claim that in the completion of every   
genuinely creative act, and in fact at some time during virtually   
every adult life, changes of this open variety take place.   
  
Whether a change is open, closed, or something of each, it in-   
volves the entire person. For this reason I have stressed throughout   
this study the relationship of personal identity to specific attitudes   
and values as well as to larger ideologies; and I have used the con-   
cept of identity as a large configuration rather than a localized   
subdivision in the mental topography. Similarly, I have spoken   
little of "persuasion" and much of pressures toward identity change.   
For I feel that belief and identity are so intimately related that   
any change in one must affect the other. This means that anyone's   
approach to ideologies, within his own culture or without, will   
invariably be strongly influenced by existing group identifications   
(or more broadly, by the need to belong), as well as by the ever-   
present inner struggle for a self-respecting personal definition. Also   
of great importance is the question of guilt, and especially ex-   
istential guilt. That which will permit a man to come to terms with   
his own feeling of limitation and at the same time afford him   
a sense of group affiliation and personal continuity is that which   
he will come to believe.   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  

----------------------- Page 394-----------------------

This psychological interplay is always related to broader historical   
influences. Problems of identity and belief are likely to become   
more widespread and intense when individual change is associated   
with rapid culture change — and during our epoch rapid culture   
change has become the rule rather than the exception. Thus the   
changing identity sequence we described for China in Chapter 19   
has important meaning for other countries still emerging from   
traditional individual and social patterns — countries in Asia, the   
Middle East, parts of Europe, Africa, and South America. Nations   
in all of these areas have, in widely diverse ways, shared an ethos   
of filialism and an identity of the filial son. Now mostly in some   
kind of transitional stage, they show strong evidence of rebellion   
against filialism and of adopting the identity of the modern   
student. Highly vocal "youth cultures" are appearing where they   
had never existed before — young people in great conflict with their   
parents and with family-oriented customs, demanding self-expres-   
sion in place of youthful deference, seeking active patterns (or   
even activism) rather than passive ones, experiencing bitter anger   
and painful guilt in connection with their rebellion, undergoing   
considerable confusion in identity, and feeling desperate ideo-   
logical hunger. This seems to be the individual pattern of culture   
change within any recently traditional society. And contesting   
ideologies — nationalism, liberal democracy (or democratic social-   
ism ) , and Communism — are also still battling as they did in China.   
  
Certainly a major task of the human sciences is to relate knowl-   
edge of specific cultures to existing universal alternatives in the   
direction of change — and to gain more understanding of the actual   
process of change in both cultures and individual people. 11 As   
John Dewey wrote in 1949, "Social 'science' waits upon a grasp   
of the fact that the only possible stable coordinations are equilibria   
of movements in respect to one another. . . . Now that practically   
all things are 'in process,' failure to study the direction in which   
they are moving constitutes the present . . . disorganization." 12   
  
In pursuing this problem, we will do well to pay special attention   
to youth groups, to men and women from sixteen to thirty years   
old. It is they who most enthusiastically espouse the change-   
stimulating ideas and ideologies. And there is good reason to believe   
that in these youth groups we can regularly see, as we saw in   
China, a culture's experimentations with its own possible future   
  
"open" personal change 469   
  
courses. I do not wish to imply that these youth group phenomena   
alone initiate culture change, for there is no denying the im-   
portance of technological and industrial development, of altered   
patterns in child-rearing and education, and of new ideologies and   
social institutions. But I do suggest that youth groups represent a   
human vanguard in the sense that they are the first and most   
intense indicators of the kinds of psychological experience and   
identity shift which will occur subsequently in adult populations   

----------------------- Page 395-----------------------

throughout a particular society.   
  
Thus, I believe that the developmental phase of late adolescence   
and early adulthood has special significance for all subsequent per-   
sonal change. This is the period in which adult identity takes   
shape, and it is the time of strong enthusiasms, of a marked tend-   
ency toward emotional polarization, of great ideological receptivity,   
and of maximum experiential intensity. I suspect that during any   
adult change it is necessary to revive in some fashion— or else   
perpetuate — the predominant patterns of this phase of life, perhaps   
even more than those of the earlier phases of childhood to which   
psychiatry presently directs so much attention. This is not to   
minimize the importance of character formation during early life,   
but rather to suggest that the altering of adult identity depends   
upon a specific recapturing of much of the emotional tone which   
prevailed at the time that this adult identity took shape. This view   
is consistent with William James' association of religious conver-   
sion with "the ordinary storm and stress and moulting-time of   
adolescence," and his conviction that "conversion is in its essence   
a normal adolescent phenomenon, incidental to the passage from   
the child's small universe to the wider intellectual and spiritual   
life of maturity." 13 The "moulting-time" of youth, then, establishes   
within each man a model for later adult change; and the sudden   
emergence of youth cultures can similarly provide a social model   
(or several alternative models) for later historical change.   
  
All of this has much bearing on the problem of ideological   
totalism. For the more intense the identity strains and patterns of   
alienation among the modern students of any country emerging   
from filialism, the greater the possibility of this group's adopting   
extremist approaches to the resolution of such strains. In China   
these took the form of Communist ideology, and the "therapy" of   
thought reform. Other countries may respond similarly to the   
  
47° THOUGHT REFORM   
  
attractions of totalism, as a means of achieving rapid economic and   
technological growth and of simultaneously dealing with identity   
tasks similar to those described for China: the destruction of   
traditional filialism, the undermining of Western liberalism, the   
mopping up of transitional chaos, and the resurrection of filial   
emotions in the service of a closed mass movement. These countries,   
insofar as their specific cultural traditions allow, could conceivably   
also adopt some thought reform-like process for the purpose of   
carrying out a similar program. In studying patterns of historical   
change, we should divest ourselves of the psychological illusion that   
a strong filial tradition is a bulwark against modern ideological   
totalism (or most specifically, Communism). The opposite seems   
to be true. It is precisely the desperate urge to sweep away decay-   
ing yet still powerful filial emotions and institutions that can call   
forth political totalism.   
  

----------------------- Page 396-----------------------

Nor are post-industrial cultures — including our own "affluent   
society" — immune from identity strains of equal severity, or from   
possible attractions to various forms of totalism. In our country,   
these attractions could stem from a sense of purposelessness, con-   
fusion, and lack of commitment; of dissatisfaction with the ritualism   
and roteness created by overorganization of our professional and   
social spheres (big society and mass society ) ; of mounting evidences   
of corrupt and irresponsible practice in public life and within com-   
munication media; and of our relative ineffectuality in the face of   
the gains of ideological rivals (including some envy of their ap-   
parent totalist efficiency). Again some of the patterns of youth   
culture may be revealing; and in American youth we encounter —   
amidst much quiet conformity — rebellion which concerns itself less   
with political preoccupations and more with patterns of social   
nihilism, iconoclastic criticism of existing cultural forms, and an   
urge for direct and absolute "experience." Indeed, the Zen Buddhist   
plunge of the American beatnik has in it some of the same element   
of total rejection of one's past, in exchange for another's past, as the   
Chinese intellectual's initial plunge into Western sociopolitical   
forms.   
  
This is not to say that totalism is by any means the sole (or even   
most probable) eventuality, either for ourselves or for the transi-   
tional cultures of which we have spoken. It rather suggests the   
faltering state of liberal alternatives to totalism, the paucity of   
  
"open" personal chance 471   
  
nontotalist social visions for the future, and the urgent necessity for   
such visions. It may be that the most fervent of liberal antitotalists   
— those most confident of their moral stand — are among those   
intellectuals who have known the most extreme forms of totalism —   
among Chinese, Poles, and Hungarians who have spoken out   
against their regimes. The actions of these groups have an additional   
significance, for they demonstrate that the open nontotalist mode   
of existence has been sufficiently experienced to have become part   
of the broad human consciousness, and is therefore likely to con-   
tinue to endure everywhere as a viable alternative to totalism. The   
youth rebellions opposing totalism in Eastern Europe, Russia, and   
China seem to combine urges toward privacy, personal freedom,   
and self-expression (frequently manifested by interest in non-   
Communist literature, art, and jazz music, or by "bourgeois ro-   
mance") with patterns of nihilism not too different from those   
found in the United States and among youths throughout the   
world.   
  
Surely the craving and the search are universal: man seeks   
new modes of existence — blending the scientific, the political, the   
artistic, and the spiritual — which will provide liberal alternatives   
to totalism along with the sense of feeling meaningfully related to   
a world whose most constant feature is change. No one can predict   
from what quarter such a vision, or elements of it, may emerge.   

----------------------- Page 397-----------------------

  
We can be sure that these alternative visions will in part depend   
upon a more accurate perception of current human transformations   
— individually, by generations, and in terms of the broader evolu-   
tionary process. It may be that this knowledge will teach us that   
we require — as has been suggested in relationship to primitive   
societies — wholistic configurations of change which take into ac-   
count all aspects of human life while at the same time permitting a   
sense of continuity with one's personal past. 14 But perhaps we shall   
also have to make a more conscious effort to preserve specific   
elements within our heritage even as so much of it is in the process   
of being altered. Certainly we must learn to live with a good deal   
of conflict, confusion, and ferment, and at the same time cultivate   
the emotional balance of "thought which recognizes limits." 15 By   
"we" I mean mankind: "the community today is the planet," 18   
and it is indeed already beyond that.   
  
In studying thought reform and related expressions of totalism,

I have been profoundly impressed with the dangers which face this   
expanding human community, dangers which arise from man's   
tendency to symbolize his universe within a suffocating circle of   
hatred. I have been equally impressed with his ingenuity in break-   
ing out of that circle, with his physical and emotional resiliency,   
and with the extraordinary scope of his imaginative faculties at   
moments when he feels his existence most threatened.

A CONFESSION DOCUMENT   
  
The following is the confession of Professor Chin   
Yiieh-lin, made during the thought reform campaign   
of 1951-52, as translated in Current Background, No. 213, Ameri-   
can Consulate General, Hong Kong, October 1, 1952. Professor   
Chin, who spent a number of years studying in this country, mostly   
at Harvard University, has been regarded as China's leading   
authority on formal logic.   
  
CRITICIZING MY IDEALISTIC BOURGEOIS   
PEDAGOGICAL IDEOLOGY   
  
By Chin Yiieh-lin   
  
(Peking Kuang Ming Jih Pao, April 17, 1952)   
  
Bom of a bureaucratic landlord family, I have always led a life   
of ease and comfort. I went abroad at nineteen and stayed there for   
eleven years to absorb the way of life and the predilection for pleas-   
ure of the European and American bourgeoisie. The principal source   

----------------------- Page 398-----------------------

of my various pleasures lay in the decadent philosophy of the   
bourgeoisie, and for thirty years I played a game of concepts. I   
was engrossed in this game of concepts because it was the only   
way for me to feel happy and free, and to escape from the restric-   
  
473   
  
474 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
tive realities of society. I thus cultivated the habit of running away   
from realities, despising realities, and leading a life isolated from   
realities. However, since I still had to live in a society of realities,   
the only way for me to maintain this life isolated from the realities   
was to gain certain privileges. I needed those privileges, and I thus   
fell a victim to the ideology of special privileges.   
  
MY CRUST OF SELFISHNESS   
  
My life in school served to form this outer crust of mine which   
can conveniently be divided into three phases:   
  
I. My decadent bourgeois philosophy. While in school, I inces-   
santly disseminated the trivialities of metaphysical idealism, in   
particular the inanities of metaphysical philosophical methods. As   
I gradually assumed a position of leadership within the Philosophy   
Department of Tsinghua, all sorts of injuries to the people's enter-   
prises inevitably resulted as manifested in: (1) I obstructed the   
development of the philosophy of materialistic dialectics in   
Tsinghua's Philosophy Department. Though I never actually tried   
to stop the discussion of materialistic dialectics among teachers   
and students, I nevertheless throttled the development of ma-   
terialistic dialectics in Tsinghua's Philosophy Department by sub-   
jecting it to attacks by a circuitous system of philosophical debate.    
(2) I trained those who concerned themselves only with the game   
of concepts, were not interested in politics, and were even re-   
actionary. As for instance, Yin Fu-sheng, one of the reactionary   
elements for whose training I was responsible, is now serving the   
Chiang bandits in Taiwan. I was further possessed of the bourgeois   
viewpoint of the education of the talented. I was thus very much   
struck by Professor Shen Yueh-ting's powers in playing the game of   
concepts. As a result of my evil influence, Professor Shen is even   
now seriously isolated from the realities. (3) I disseminated the   
purely technical viewpoint in logic. For twenty years I taught logic   
to numerous students. All the time, however, I only tried to teach   
logic from the formalistic viewpoint, as for instance I was only   
concerned with the correctness of the reasoning without caring   
about the truthfulness of the premises. My mistaken viewpoint of   
education for the talented led me to think highly of Wang Hao,   
who even now is serving the interests of American imperialism by   
being connected with an American university. (4) I encouraged the   
  
A CONFESSION DOCUMENT 475   

----------------------- Page 399-----------------------

  
development of sectarianism within Tsinghua's Philosophy Depart-   
ment by stressing the highly involved analysis of concepts and the   
formulation of circuitous systems of philosophy as the most im-   
portant aspects of philosophy. I then thought that the Philosophy   
Department of Tsinghua was very good in these respects. This sort   
of sectarianism was inevitably one of the facts which obstructed the   
regulation of the departments and colleges.   
  
II. My decadent "above-politics," "above-class," "out-of-the-   
world", and "above-humanity" philosophy of life. Before the libera-   
tion, having absolutely no idea of the truth that the human world   
is created through labor, I mistakenly took the human race to be   
insignificant and the history of the human race to be but a minor   
episode in the main stream. I therefore tended to despise the   
world, and to become above-politics and above-class. My preoccupa-   
tion with this decadent philosophy of life led > me to despise   
administrative work. I consequently tried by all means to minimize   
my personal affairs and adopted an attitude of absolute indifference   
toward all things. When I was charged with administrative work   
after the liberation, my mistaken attitude inevitably resulted in   
idiotic bureaucratism. Though a member of the University Adminis-   
tration Committee, I spoke up only once in all its meetings, and   
I honestly had nothing to talk about; and though the Dean of the   
College of Arts really had very little to do, what little there was   
I neglected altogether. For instance, I never seemed to remember   
that I was actually the Dean of the College of Arts when handling   
such matters as the resumption of publication of the Tsinghua   
Journal, the maintenance of proper relationship between the dif-   
ferent colleges and departments, etc. As Chairman of the Philos-   
ophy Department, I left the affairs of the department to take care   
of themselves, and I never bothered to do anything about personnel   
appointments within the department.   
  
III. My ideology of special privileges. In order to maintain my   
way of life, I had to have special privileges. I felt the need for these   
privileges, I enjoyed these privileges, became obsessed by the ideology   
of special privileges, and I became one of the privileged few of   
Tsinghua. Though I was privileged, I yet refused to shoulder the ac-   
companying responsibilities. Thus, while I enjoyed special privileges   
in Tsinghua, yet I never burdened myself with administrative work.   
  
The three above-mentioned phases constituted the main ingre-   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
dients of my crust. The scope of the crust was moreover variable:   
one crust represented my individual self, one crust the Philosophy   
Department, while another represented Tsinghua. My personal crust   
being the "core" of this miniature universe, I accordingly remained   
completely indifferent to things which had little to do with my   
personal interests. Whenever the matter in question was in con-   

----------------------- Page 400-----------------------

flict with my personal crust, I always sallied forth to give battle.   
As for instance, when the son of Professor Liang Ssu-ch'eng wanted   
to change his registration from the History Department to the   
Architecture Department, I, as an old friend of the family who   
knew him when he was born, tried to help him, in the thought that   
he was more suited to the study of architecture. Though there are   
certain strict restrictions in connection with the change of registra-   
tion from one department to another, yet I made use of my special   
privileges to work on his behalf which resulted in a series of serious   
mistakes. This is but one example of a situation which conflicted   
with my personal crust. I opposed the reform of curriculum be-   
cause I wanted to maintain the crust of the Philosophy Department   
in Tsinghua. When the regulation of departments and colleges   
started in 1950, I was dead against it, for my most outstanding   
crust was Tsinghua University. Motivated by departmentalism,   
sectarianism, and the educational ideology of the bourgeoisie, I   
was of infinite harm to the program for the regulation of depart-   
ments and colleges. Had the regulation of departments and col-   
leges been carried out in 1950, then Tsinghua alone would have   
turned out another 5,000-6,000 cadres, and a far larger number   
would have been turned out throughout the country. Incalculable   
harm has thus been caused the democratic construction program   
of the entire country. For this I now hate myself beyond measure.   
  
MY POLITICAL ATTITUDE   
  
My crust is based on the past prevailing economic social founda-   
tion, that is, the capitalistic social system. In order to protect this   
crust, I had to give my political support to the old system of democ-   
racy. As a confirmed individualistic liberal, I have always based my   
political attitude upon this point of view. Only now have I realized   
that fact that the old democracy is but the dictatorship of the   
bourgeois class, and the so-called individual freedom is but the   
"freedom" for the bourgeoisie to exploit and oppress the laboring   
  
A CONFESSION DOCUMENT 477   
  
people. My numerous criminal deeds of the past should thus be   
attributed to my acceptance of individual liberalism.   
  
With regard to my attitude toward American imperialism, as   
a result of long years of studying in America, the evil influences of   
bourgeois education, my large number of American friends, and my   
constant contact with Americans, I became instilled with pro-   
American thoughts which prevented me from realizing American   
imperialism's plots of aggression against China during the past   
hundred years, and turned me into an unconscious instrument of   
American imperialistic cultural aggression. I cried bitterly over the   
Twenty-one Demands, but took no notice of the Sino-American   
Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation. While I was   
highly indignant at the time of the Tsinan Incident during the   
Northern Expedition, and was all for resisting Japan when the Muk-   

----------------------- Page 401-----------------------

den incident and the Luguochiao Incident took place, I never-   
theless remained blind to the misdeeds of American soldiers in   
China. In 1943 I was one of the Chinese professors who went to   
America on the invitation of the American State Department.   
There, totally deprived of my national standpoint as a result of my   
pro-American thoughts, I even tried to persuade the American   
State Department to force bandit Chiang to practice democracy.   
  
With regard to my attitude toward the Soviet Union, in always   
looking at the USSR from the viewpoint of old democracy, I   
consistently distorted and slandered the Soviet Union, and right   
up to the liberation I thought that individual "freedom" does not   
exist in the Soviet Union. I considered both the October Revolu-   
tion and the purges within the Party to be "going too far," and   
that the Soviet Union made use of the Communist Party in other   
countries to interfere in their internal affairs. All these ideas were   
of course mistaken and reactionary. My principal mistake lay in   
thinking of the Soviet Union as devoid of individual freedom. At   
that time, in failing to take the October Revolution as an epoch-   
making great event of history, I only tried to antagonize the Soviet   
Union on the basis of my individual liberal pro-America ideology.   
It was only after the liberation that I succeeded gradually in gain-   
ing an understanding of true freedom, and thus to change my at-   
titude toward the Soviet Union.   
  
With regard to student movements, I nearly always maintained   
a negative and double-faced attitude toward all the student move-   
  
THOUGHT REFORM   
  
ments I came across in my teaching career. On the one hand I   
"loathed" the Kuomintang of the Chiang bandits, while on the   
other hand I opposed the Communist Party of China. I say   
"loathed" advisedly, because I never tried to oppose them by any   
positive effort. Before I left for America in 1943, I had to go through   
five days of Kuomintang training in Chungking before I could get   
my passport, and had to write a short essay of two hundred words   
on the advisability for local officials to visit the central govern-   
ment. This was really a shame. Though I honestly loathed the   
Kuomintang, this was not what mattered. The important thing was   
that I opposed the Chinese Communists. This dualism in my make-   
up was best shown at the time of the December First Incident [a   
student movement which took place in 1945 in Kunming]. Though   
I was highly enthusiastic at the start of the movement, when I   
followed the footsteps of the progressive elements, I later lost my   
interest and finally I stood for the resumption of class. This was   
because I opposed the Communists. Soon after the end of the   
movement I quarreled with Professor Chang Hsi-jo and I told   
him in the sternest manner and in tears that, "It is you people who   
made such a mess of China. After depriving China of 'freedom,'   
it will take I don't know how many years to have it restored."   
  

----------------------- Page 402-----------------------

As viewed from the three above-mentioned aspects, my political   
attitude was truly intolerable. How was it possible that though early   
in life I loved my country and wanted to save her from the fate   
of partition, yet I turned out to be such a fool later? On this   
point I have to charge the American imperialists who made use   
of a mission school, that is, Tsinghua College, and of the education   
I received while in America, to turn me into an instrument of Amer-   
ican imperialistic cultural aggression, deprived me of my national   
standpoint, prevented me from making a distinction between our   
friends and our enemies, and led me to do things detrimental to   
the people.   
  
MY IDEOLOGICAL CHANGE   
  
My preliminary understanding of the People's Liberation Army   
and the Communist Party. The miracles of the People's Liberation   
Army demanded my whole-hearted respect. I never thought such   
discipline possible, and they love the people so much. In the early   
days after the liberation, I was highly moved by an episode involv-   
  
A CONFESSION DOCUMENT 479   
  
ing the son of my maid Liu. When her son, who was working in a   
certain factory, misbehaved himself, certain soldiers of the PLA   
stationed in that factory tried to reform him by education. When   
this failed, two comrades of the PLA approached Liu to request her   
to go and reform her son. In the end, the two soldiers treated   
the mother to a meal and finally saw her home. I consider such   
a fighting force as unique in history. In the spring of 1949, I was   
fortunate enough to have the chance to listen to a series of reports   
rendered by various senior Party cadres. There attitude was so very   
honest and sincere and they were always prepared to practice what   
they preach. Though all occupying senior positions within the   
Party, they yet were always ready to admit their mistakes publicly   
before the masses. Such a party I consider unprecedented in China.   
However, this kind of recognition was only the preliminary stage   
of cognition through emotion, something within the capability of   
all Chinese.   
  
My change in philosophical ideology. Generally speaking this   
change can be divided into three periods. During the first period,   
I was still unable to link up the actualities of the revolution with   
Marxism-Leninism. Though I had already acquired a preliminary   
understanding of the Communist Party and the PLA, yet this did   
not mean that I was ready to accept materialistic dialectics and   
historical dialectics. When Comrade Ai Ssu-ch'i lectured in Tsing-   
hua, I even tried to argue with him. Starting from the months   
of March and April 1949, I began to attend various meetings for   
the exchange of philosophical opinions. Even at that time I still   
held two mistaken points of view: in the first place I still looked   
upon materialistic dialectics and the old philosophy as equals, and,   
under the illusion that our Communist comrades were ignorant   

----------------------- Page 403-----------------------

of the old philosophy, had the wish to initiate them in the mysteries   
of old philosophy; in the second place, in the mistaken idea that   
materialistic dialectics and historical dialectics were not well sys-   
tematized, I thought of putting them to order by means of my   
trivial system of analysis. My unbelievable arrogance and ignorance   
was the result of the fact that I was still looking at materialistic   
dialectics on the basis of the old philosophy. As I took part in the   
first attempt at curriculum reform in the above mentioned spirit,   
naturally nothing was accomplished. The Philosophy Department   
was thus prevented from making any progress.   
  
480 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
The second period lasted roughly from the start of the second   
attempt at curriculum reform in 1950 to the spring of 1951. From   
the very start of this period I had already accepted the leading posi-   
tion of materialistic dialectics, and rectified my two above-men-   
tioned mistakes. I then considered materialistic dialectics as a piece   
of red string linking up all different branches of knowledge. Yet,   
though I admitted its importance in an abstract fashion, my real   
interests were still focused on philosophy, as one of the branches   
of knowledge linked up by materialistic dialectics. In this manner   
I was still trying to oppose the new philosophy by the old. Both   
on the basis of my mistaken views and in compliance to the then   
prevailing conditions in Tsinghua's Philosophy Department, I   
proposed to divide the departments into three groups: history of   
philosophy, logic, and history of art. Since this amounted to change   
in name only but not change in substance, I again succeeded in   
preventing Tsinghua's Philosophy Department from making any   
progress.   
  
In the spring of 1951, I went regularly into the city to make a   
study of On Practice [an essay by Mao Tse-tung]. It was during   
this period that a radical change began to take place in my ideology.   
For almost two years before this, I had been going to the city   
regularly every Sunday to take part in the study activities of the   
Chinese Philosophy Society. Whatever I gained in the course of   
these two years, coupled with my study of On Practice, enabled me   
to realize the fundamental difference in nature between materialistic   
dialectics and the old philosophy. The old philosophy, being meta-   
physical, is fundamentally unscientific, while the new philosophy,   
being scientific, is the supreme truth. It was during the Curriculum   
Reform Campaign of 1951 that I succeeded in realizing that the   
mission of the Philosophy Department lies in the training of propa-   
ganda personnel for the dissemination of Marxism-Leninism. This   
time the curriculum reform was carried out in a comparatively   
thorough manner. However, insofar as my understanding of ma-   
terialistic dialectics was still based on abstract concepts, it inevitably   
brought serious consequences to Tsinghua's Philosophy Department.   
  
THE DANGERS OF IDEALISM AND BOURGEOIS PEDAGOGICAL IDEOLOGY   
TO THE PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENT   

----------------------- Page 404-----------------------

  
Idealism and bourgeois pedagogical ideology have always oc-   
cupied a leading position in Tsinghua's Philosophy Department,   
  
A CONFESSION DOCUMENT 481   
  
and I have all the time been an outstanding representative of this   
decadent ideology. This situation has remained more or less un-   
changed right from the liberation up to the moment. This naturally   
resulted in huge losses. In the main, our principal defects lay in our   
low level of political consciousness and the dislocation of theory   
from practice. The concrete manifestations are as follows:   
  
To deal with materialistic dialectics by means of the analysis of   
concepts really amounts to the exposition of Marxism-Leninism   
by means of idealistic metaphysical methods. As for instance, should   
we try to carry out in class a conceptual analysis of "necessity and   
contingency" and "relative truth and absolute truth," we would   
inevitably fall into the trap of running around in abstract circles   
of concepts, with the students getting more and more confused. To   
teach Marxism-Leninism in such a manner can only result in the   
distortion of Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism which in itself   
is concrete, militant, and should serve as the guide for our action,   
has, in our hands, been turned into a lifeless and abstract heap of   
concepts.   
  
Under the influence of this kind of idealistic bourgeois pedagogi-   
cal ideology, certain students naturally fell a victim to idealism.   
A student by the name of Li Hsiieh-chin is, in this respect, an out-   
standing example. Li entered Tsinghua in 1951, and within half   
a year he managed to read up on Wang Yang-ming [the idealist   
philosopher of the Ming Dynasty], the Buddhist philosophy of   
Hsiung Shih-li, Moslem philosophy, and various other obscure books.   
When certain students felt they were unable to study the subjects   
they needed, they naturally changed their registration to other de-   
partments. Of the thirteen students of the class of 1949, nine de-   
cided to enter other departments; of the seven students of the class   
of 1950, five changed to other departments; and of the eight stu-   
dents of the class of 1951, two are going to change their registration   
to other departments.   
  
Another undesirable manifestation in pedagogy lay in the dog-   
matic attempt to stuff the students with various theories, without   
taking pains to solve the ideological problems of the students. In-   
asmuch as materialistic dialectics is one of the subjects taught in   
the general political course attended by the entire school, I only   
tried to deal with materialistic dialectics in a supplementary manner,   
in the mistaken idea that the responsibility for the solution of   
ideological problems lay with the general political course, while   
  
482 THOUGHT REFORM   
  

----------------------- Page 405-----------------------

in teaching materialistic dialectics in the Philosophy Department   
we only had to deal with the theoretical aspects. I thus erred in   
idealistically divorcing the problems of ideology and theory to   
cause the students great confusion.   
  
Though Marxism-Leninism is designed to solve practical prob-   
lems, yet in our hands, it is fundamentally unable to solve the ideo-   
logical problem of the students. To cite three graduates of the 1950   
class of the Philosophy Department as examples: one by the name   
of Tang entered the graduate school of the Philosophy Depart-   
ment, but he was all the time more interested in mathematics;   
another graduate by the name of Chou gave up all his former train-   
ing to enter the Physics Department of Peita; while still another   
graduate by the name of Shui, though he had already qualified   
for the graduate school of the Philosophy Department, yet chose   
to enter Peita to study chemistry. Though all three students had   
ideological trouble, yet neither I nor the other teachers of the   
Philosophy Department succeeded in giving them timely assist-   
ance. Of this year's freshman students in the Philosophy Depart-   
ment, eight have already signified their wish to change their regis-   
tration. With the situation in our department even as serious as   
it was, we still failed to notice it, not to say remedy the situation.   
It is entirely due to the fact that we were so badly poisoned our-   
selves that we failed to notice the seriousness of the situation and   
to rectify it.   
  
In the bourgeois pedagogical method there is fundamentally no   
relationship between the teacher and the student. I myself only   
went to class to lecture, without caring whether the students un-   
derstood me or whether they had any problems. I often missed   
classroom discussions, and I had no concern for the life, ideology,   
and state of health of the students. In adopting a liberalist attitude   
towards the students' studies, the teachers of the Philosophy De-   
partment always left everything to the individual efforts of the stu-   
dents. As for instance, we remained ignorant of the fact that a   
certain student studied for as many as seventy hours a week, and   
we certainly would not have done anything had we known it.   
  
Though the mission of the Philosophy Department lies in the   
training of cadres for the dissemination of Marxism-Leninism, yet   
as a result of the predominance of idealistic philosophy and ped-   
agogical practice within the department, we inevitably failed to   
  
A CONFESSION DOCUMENT   
  
carry out this task, thus bringing about the above-mentioned   
harmful effects. Whereas this responsibility should be borne by   
all the professors of the Philosophy Department, the greater part   
of the guilt should be attributed to me for I led them to become   
estranged from politics and isolated from realities.   
  
THE TEACHERS' STUDY MOVEMENT AND THE THREE-ANTI CAMPAIGN   

----------------------- Page 406-----------------------

  
As stated above, it was in the spring of 1951 that I began to realize   
the scientific and truthful nature of Marxism-Leninism, though this   
realization was even then abstract and conceptual. Before the start   
of the study movement for the teachers of Peking and Tientsin   
and the Three-Anti Campaign, I failed to link up Marxism-Lenin-   
ism both with the realities in general and with my personal case.   
Though I took part in numerous activities in and out of Tsinghua,   
these activities never influenced me to any appreciable degree. It   
was only at the start of the teachers' study movement that I suc-   
ceeded in linking myself up, criticizing my old democratic individ-   
ual liberalistic ideology, and taking the first step in gaining a cor-   
rect understanding of the Soviet Union and of American imperial-   
ism. I was still unable to gain a correct understanding of my former   
ideological self. It was only at the start of the Three-Anti Campaign   
that I began to understand my former self, my crust of selfishness,   
and my ideological shortcomings. Late in the spring of 1951, I   
began to try to become a good teacher of the people. However,   
I never was able to succeed in this. Not only did I fail, but I even   
committed the gravest mistakes. With the assistance of others and   
following my own preliminary analysis, I now consider the funda-   
mental ideological source for my personal crust of selfishness to   
be the extremely depraved, epicurean, liberalist, and bourgeois   
ideology of striving after individual freedom. The philosophical   
manifestation of this ideology was found in my preoccupation   
with the completely impractical and extremely abstract game of   
concepts. In personal philosophy of life, this ideology was mani-   
fested in my decadent "above-politics," "above-class," "above-the-   
world," and "above-humanity" viewpoint. In actual life at school,   
this ideology was manifested in my attempt to maintain my life of   
ease and comfort and to build up a crust of special privileges. This   
kind of ideology was the ideology of the exploitative class, or rather   
the exploitative ideology of the "share-holders" and "behind-the-   
  
484 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
scene-boss" of the exploitative class. It was owing to this ideology   
that I was led to become estranged from the social realities and   
prevented from gaining a correct understanding of the people even   
after the liberation. I shall smash my personal crust and eradicate   
the bourgeois ideologies which have for years dominated my life.   
  
MY DETERMINATION   
  
He who loves New China well must know that in New China   
the people are on their feet and have come into their own. There

From now on, however, I shall strive to become a new man and

'Vincent, like many of my Western subjects, knew enough spoken Chinese   
so that most of his reform could be conducted in that language; and his   
fluency greatly improved during his ordeal. A bilingual fellow prisoner (or,   
during interrogations, an official translator) was always available for Chinese-   
English interpretation, however.   
  
'The judge is actually a high-ranking prison official, and the interrogations

4 Here, and in the next case as well, I could not be sure that the recollection   
of sleep-deprivation was completely accurate; I believe that in both cases it   
was reasonably so, although the subjects may have neglected to report brief   
periods of dozing. The officials always allowed prisoners to get sleep enough   
to be able to participate in the interrogations, but sometimes during this early   
period of imprisonment they were permitted little more.   
  
CHAPTER 4 ( 38-64)   
  
'This was part of a widespread change in prison policy in 1952 and 1953.   
Some, but not all, of the extreme practices, especially those within the cells,   
were curbed. After this change, in many prisons individual prisoners were pro-   
hibited from discussing the criminal details of their cases with cellmates; these   
were to be reserved for sessions with prison officials. A prisoner was still ex-   
pected to confess details of personal evil within the cell, but primarily in con-   
nection with the re-education process.

'Much of the intense anxiety stimulated during this early phase thus be-   
comes associated with guilt. But in addition, a certain amount of anxiety arising   
in connection with the developing sense of guilt may be perceived simply as   
anxiety, while the guilt remains unconscious. Piers has proposed the term   
"guilt anxiety" as a more accurate description of this phenomenon. I have not   
used it here because I have found that it also can be a source of confusion.

"See Gert Heilbrunn, "The Basic Fear," Journal of the American Psycho-

is entirely possible," Young Man Luther, W. W. Norton & Co, New York,   
1958, 111. William James has also described "the fear of the universe" of "sick   
souls" prior to the experience of religious conversion: The Varieties of Religious   
Experience, Longmans, Green and Co, London, 1952.   
  
'Erving GoSman reports that, in the parlance of the society of the mental   
hospital, a psychotic episode is "hitting the bottom"; this phrase contains an   
element of affirmation — the understanding that the patient to whom this has   
happened "can come up in some sense a changed person." See Goffman's   
discussion in "Chinese Communist Thought Reform," Group Processes, supra,   
265. See also, in the same volume, Goffman's paper, "Characteristics of Total   
Institutions."   
  
"The alternation between kind and vindictive interrogators, like the more   
general alternation between leniency and assault, is a technique of thought   
reform which is also widely used in penal and interrogative settings every-   
where. But the possibility always exists that the solicitous concern of a particu-   
lar officials — such as the doctor mentioned in this passage, or one of the inter-   
rogators — is genuine, and independent of reform policy. Even if it is, however,   
it may have the same effects upon the prisoner; he is indeed hard put to dis-   
tinguish between the technical maneuver and the humane sentiment.   
  
'This concept was originally elaborated by Theodor Reik, The Compulsion   

----------------------- Page 410-----------------------

to Confess, Farrar, Straus and Cudahy, New York, 1959. It has also been used   
extensively by Joost A. M. Meerloo (The Rape of the Mind, World Publishing   
Co, New York, 1956, and in earlier articles listed therein) in connection with   
various forms of totalitarian mental coercion. I use the concept somewhat   
differently from either of these writers, although I have profited from both of   
their work. See also James Clark Moloney, "Psychic Self-Abandon and Extor-   
tion of Confessions," International Journal of Psychoanalysis (1955) 36:53-60.

in the fact of self-awareness" and which he distinguishes from neurotic guilt.   
  
488 THOUGHT REFORM   
  
He also stresses, as I wish to stress here, that such guilt is universal, occurring   
in all cultures, and that under ordinary circumstances its recognition can lead   
to highly constructive effects. See also, Paul Tillich, The Courage to Be, New   
Haven, Yale University Press, 1952, 52.   
  
u Some of the communication concepts which I employ here and in later   
sections have been suggested by the writings of Jurgen Ruesch and Gregory   
Bateson. See J. Ruesch and G. Bateson, Communication: The Social Matrix of

CHAPTER 6 (86-116)   
  
1 Erikson locates the identity crisis "in that period of the life cycle when each   
youth must forge for himself some central perspective and direction, some work-   
ing unity, out of the effective remnants of his childhood and the hopes of his   
anticipated adulthood; he must detect some meaningful resemblance between   
what he has come to see in himself and what his sharpened awareness tells him   
others judge and expect him to be" (Young Man Luther, 14).   
  
•The immense personal value of such a research attitude in "extreme situa-   
tions" was movingly demonstrated by Bruno Bettelheim in a report of his   
observations made while he was in a Nazi concentration camp. He describes   
this as follows: "The study of these behaviors was a mechanism developed by   
him [Bettelheim — he refers to himself in the third person] ad hoc in order   
that he might ... in this way be better equipped to endure life in the camp.   
His observing and collecting of data should ... be considered as a particular   
type of defense developed in such an extreme situation . . . based on this par-   
ticular prisoner's background, training, and interests. It was developed to protect   
this individual against a disintegration of his personality." The two situations   
differed in many respects, but the investigative attitude was helpful in both.   
See Bettelheim, "Individual and Mass Behavior in Extreme Situations," Jour-   
nal of Abnormal and Social Psychology (1953) 38:417-452.   
  
' Men and women in this category were in fact frequently capable, just after   

----------------------- Page 411-----------------------

their release, of making the kind of probing (and sometimes exaggerated) criti-   
cisms of the West characteristic of those who have become acutely alienated   
from — and hypersensitive to the shortcomings of — their own cultural institutions.   
Thus, when Dr. Vincent spoke of the wasted time spent by the Westerners   
living in Hong Kong ("spending four hours for nothing — between one drink   
and another smoke and wait for tomorrow"), he was of course expressing his   
own sense of dislocation; but he was also observing, through magnifying emo-   
tional lenses, real problems of purposelessness within the non-Communist   
world.

2 The importance of anticipation and anticipatory behavior in human inter-   
change is generally neglected in psychological theory. See David McK. Rioch,   
"Psychiatry as a Biological Science," Psychiatry (1955) 18:313-321. Rioch   
stresses the importance of anticipatory influences in thought, reverie processes,   
and other subjective experience. He goes on to state that "behavior in anticipa-   
tion of probable environmental responses ... is the behavior primarily studied   
in psychiatry."   
  
"Avoidance of emotional participation was extremely difficult in Chinese   
prisons because of the environment's constant demand for active involvement.   
Within the less intensive thought reform programs of Chinese-run prisoner-of-   
war camps in Korea, however, psychological withdrawal was widespread. It   
was associated with "playing it cool," which meant being unresponsive and   
minimally communicative, co-operating to some extent with captors, but only   
to the degree considered necessary to avoid reprisals. (One repatriate expressed   
this to me in a vivid, characteristically American, automotive metaphor: "I   
just put my mind in neutral.") This useful form of withdrawal must be dis -   
tinguished from more profound — and frequently self-destructive — forms of   
apathy. See H. D. Strassmann, Margaret Thaler, and E. H. Schein, "A Prisoner   
of War Syndrome: Apathy as a Reaction to Severe Stress," American Journal   
of Psychiatry (1956) 112:998-1003; Schein, "The Chinese Indoctrination   
Program," supra; and Lifton, Home by Ship, Note 2, Chapter 1 .   
  
4 Prison officials do take great pains to prevent martyrdom, suicide, death,   
and irreversible psychosis; but the prisoner is nonetheless inevitably made to feel   
that his physical and emotional survival is at stake. And in such an extreme   
atmosphere, the danger always exists that the officials themselves will lose con-   

----------------------- Page 412-----------------------

trol over their self-restraints to the extent of genuinely threatening the prisoner's   
survival — as did happen to Father Luca.

"This similarity may have some relationship to an observation made on the   
basis of psychological tests about repatriated prisoners of war: namely, that   
the two extreme groups — resisters and collaborators, both of which were op-   
posed to the in-between group of neutrals — shared a common tendency toward   
action, active involvement, and acting out in the face of stress, a tendency   
which testers felt was related to their greater self-confidence. See Schein, in   
"Methods of Forceful Indoctrination," supra; and Margaret Thaler Singer and   
E. H. Schein, "Projective Test Responses of Prisoners of War Following   
Repatriation," Psychiatry (1958) 21:375-385. It is impossible to say to what   
degree these traits among prisoners of war may be aspects of totalism, and   
the different nature of the activity-inactivity and activity-passivity problems ex-   
isting within prisoners of war camps must be kept in mind. But it does seem   
significant that these investigators found, as I did, important psychological   
similarities within subjects at the two extreme poles of response.

1 His urge to "be free" was also involved in this exaggerated activity. I am   
not certain of its full significance, but there is evidence (for instance, his

statement about not having left the cell for a year and a half) that he was   
experiencing a delayed sense of confinement carried over from his imprison-   
ment, as if he were perceiving for the first time the full impact of those years   
of physical and emotional restraint. This, plus the confining elements of his   
new environment — its real intellectual, geographical, and interpersonal limita-   
tions as compared with the exhilarating and adventurous life he had led in   
China before his imprisonment and to some extent during his imprisonment   
as well — seemed to create within him an oppressive sense of spiritual claustro-   
phobia. He could find no outlet for his special creative talents, particularly   
his talent for personal mediation; and his impulses toward flight and escape   
must have added to his burden of guilt.

process can occur when one is separated from an environment which holds spe-   
cial emotional significance for him. See Sigmund Freud, "Mourning and Melan-

woods, the blue Juniata ... a home to which they couldn't go back," [9]),   
then concludes that "when all the paths are seen from a distance they seem   
to be interwoven into a larger pattern of exile (if only in spirit) and return   
from exile, of alienation and reintegration" (292). My phrase, "expatriate's   
return," was partly inspired by Cowley's title, and this section owes much to his   
stimulating views of his literary generation.

18 Latourette, op. cit., 131-155, presents a comprehensive discussion of the   
entire Rites Controversy. He expresses the view that Papal policy "tended   
... to keep the Roman Catholic church [in China] a foreign institution";   
but he does not believe that had the opposite decision been made, the Jesuits   
would have succeeded — as many have thought possible — in creating a Chi-   
nese Church which would have won the entire country to Christianity. Although   
this early Jesuit mission effort failed to accomplish its evangelizing task in   
China, however, it did succeed in making the virtues of Chinese Confucianism   
known to educated Europeans, and especially to the leading philosophers of the   
Enlightenment. Men like Leibniz and Voltaire delighted in the democratic   
and rationalist elements of Confucianism, although they were not fully aware   
that the Confucianism about which the Jesuits reported in their letters to   
Europe was the classical ideal rather than the orthodoxy which already had   
come into being, or that the Jesuits themselves tended to exaggerate these   
virtues because of their urge to mediate between the two cultures. It is un-   
doubtedly going too far to call Confucius, as some have, "the patron saint   
of the Enlightenment," or to claim that "Chinese philosophy was without   
doubt the basic cause of the French Revolution"; but there is a good deal of   
evidence that the early Jesuit missionaries did as much to spread Confucian   
ideals in Europe as Christian ideals in China. See H. G. Creel, Confucius, The

up primarily for intellectuals, those for both intellectuals and nonintellectuals,   
and those for people of relatively limited educational background. The center   
described in this chapter is of the first type. These centers were sometimes   
referred to as simply "universities" or "research institutes," with no "revolu-   
tionary." These distinctions were not always followed, however, and since the   
over-all emotional pattern was the same in all three, I have referred to "revolu-   
tionary university" and "revolutionary college" interchangeably.

8 Such symptoms of general stress were always common, but it is difficult to   
evaluate the relative occurrence of the more malignant psychological experiences   
of suicide and psychosis. One must keep in mind that a certain number of

these occur among young people at educational institutions of any kind; but it   
is likely that the reform pressures were of great importance in precipitating the   
ones described here.

(quoted in the notes to Chapter 2, supra), Ai Ssu-ch'i produced, in his earlier   

----------------------- Page 416-----------------------

writing, a number of popular statements on Marxism. The most famous of   
these was a book actually called Popular Philosophy, to which Hu was probably   
referring. Although originally aimed at the relatively uneducated common man,   
this book achieved immense popularity among secondary school and university   
students as well, and went through thirty-two editions during the twelve years   
after its publication in 1936. Part of its appeal lay in its utter simplicity and   
in its promise of total salvation through Marxism; see Gourley, op. cit., Note   
2, Chapter 14, 45-50.

* It is striking to note how many ways Hu's life history corresponds to the   
universal myth of the hero, as extracted from mythologies of cultures through-   
out the world: the hero is a child of distinguished parents (or, in Hu's case,   
of one distinguished parent); his origin is preceded by difficulties; as a child   
he is surrendered to the care of others, frequently "suckled by a common   
woman"; he has a "call to adventure" (Hu's first summons to leadership by   
fellow students); then faces a series of "difficult tasks" or "road of trials" (for   
Hu, before and during thought reform); and finally achieves "atonement with   
the father," a reconciliation which combines revenge, submission, and diminu-   
tion of early fear. In the myths, the hero's final accomplishment is to right the   
wrongs done his people, and achieve for them a higher level of accomplishment   
and wisdom. Hu has already done some of this, but his present fate seems to   
be that of additional personal trials. See Joseph Campbell, The Hero with a   
Thousand Faces, New York, Meridian Books, 1956; Otto Rank, The Myth of   
the Birth of the Hero, New York, Vintage Books, 1959; and Clyde Kluckhohn,   
"Recurrent Themes in Myths and Mythmaking," Daedalus, Spring, 1959, 268.   
  
4 Thus Gourley, op. cit., ii-iii, states, "A cadre is an 'activist', a dynamic   
element, who serves as the transmission belt between the Party, the State, and   
the masses. He . . . is at all times connected with the activity of the Party,   
and expresses the point-of-view of the Party."

1 The historical themes discussed in this chapter will necessarily be selective,   
chosen because of their important bearing upon the psychological issues with   
which this book is concerned. Thus I wish to stress that filialism is just one   
strain of traditional Chinese Confucianism — a- vital strain, and crucial to all   
patterns of authority, but by no means encompassing the entire social and   
philosophical world of traditional China. Similarly, in discussing certain basic   
psychological trends, I do not wish to lose sight of the diversity and conflict   
always present in traditional China; these are revealed in Wright's and Fair-   
bank's volumes on Chinese thought already referred to, and by a third volume   
in the series, Confucianism in Action, edited by David S. Nivison, Stanford,   
Calit., Stanford University Press, 1959.

"Conflicts could arise, however, between the two commitments — between   
the filial son and the loyal official. This happened to Chao Pao, the governor   
of a frontier province during the second century A.D. Enemy forces captured   
Chao's mother and threatened to put her to death unless he surrendered his   
armies. Faced by this moral dilemma, he fought and defeated the enemy, thus   
sacrificing his mother's life. After the war, he was said to have died of grief   
at his mother's grave. But in subsequent commentaries (this incident was   
a frequent subject for ethical discussion for more than a thousand years) Chao   
was criticized — for being an "extremist" who took only one aspect of the situa-   
tion into account, and for failing to make some attempt, even if unsuccessful,   
to save his mother's life. The prevailing principle (strongly reinforced in the   
writings of Mencius) was that if such a conflict should arise, the duty of the   
son as a son should receive first consideration. (Fung, in Northrop, ed., op. cit,   
29-30).   
  
* There are reports of protests against government corruption and inefficiency   
by students of the Imperial College during the Han Period (25-220 A.D.)   
and Southern Sung Period (1127-1279 A.D.); and of scholars leading political   
criticism for some time during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 A.D.). But these   
were essentially demands for adherence to the ideals of traditional ethics —   
examples of scholars serving as guardians of principles — rather than youth   
rebellions in the modern sense. See Wen-han Kiang, The Chinese Student

condemned in Chinese culture: the tendencies, in the face of personal oppres-   
sion, to remain passive, to rationalize philosophically, or to take out resentment   
on those lower in the social hierarchy. "Ah Q-ism" became a term of rebuke,

8 In this section I shall not enter into the long-standing controversy over dis-   
tinctions between psychoanalysis and psychonanalytic therapy, or between medi-   
cal and nonmedical psychoanalytic and psychotherapeutic work. I believe that   
the principles expressed here apply, at least in spirit, to all of these agents of   
psychological re-education. What I say about psychoanalytic training is most   
specific to that situation, but may also be applied in lesser degree to other   
forms of psychological and psychiatric (or, medical psychological) training.   
Similarly, the ideas expressed about transference, resistance, and reality apply to   
all forms of psychoanalytically-influenced therapeutic work, while those about   
milieu therapy relate primarily to hospital settings. Ideas about theory apply to   
all systematic attempts to understand man.

" In his presidential address of that year to the American Psychoanalytic   
Association (Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy, 177-178), Alexander stated:   
"They [psychoanalysts] should lose the defensive attitude of a minority group,   
the militant soldiers of a Weltanschaung attacked by and therefore antagonistic   
to the world. Rather than disseminators of the gospel, they must become self-   
critical scientists. For psychoanalysis as a whole, this leads to the simple but   
unavoidable conclusion that the sooner psychoanalysis as a 'movement' disap-   
pears, the better."

further raise the question of whether such totalism might not be one of the   
truly fundamental aspects of the hypnotic process.
