 so good there is no private string becouse code apply directly to base class
 public class DerivedOptions : ComplexOptions
 {
     public override string Virtual
     {
         get
         {
             return base.Virtual;
         }
         set
         {
             base.Virtual = "Derived:" + value;
         }
     }
 }
