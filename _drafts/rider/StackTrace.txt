sort out:
Exception already has a StackTrace property; however, this
property returns a simple string—not a StackTrace object. A
StackTrace object is far more useful in logging exceptions
that occur after deployment—where no .pdb files are available
—because you can log the IL offset in lieu of line and column
numbers. With an IL offset and ildasm, you can pinpoint
where within a method an error occurred.
