1. Tell me about yourself.
This question seems [ˈsiːmz] simple, so [ˈsəʊ] many people fail to prepare for it [ɪt], but [bʌt] it [ɪt]’s [ˈes] crucial [ˈkruːʃl̩]. Here's [ˈes] the deal: Don’t give your complete employment [ɪmˈploɪmənt] (or personal) history. Instead, give a pitch—one [wʌn] that’s [ˈes] concise [kənˈsaɪs] and compelling [kəmˈpelɪŋ] and that shows [ʃəʊz] exactly why you’re the right fit for the job. Muse [mjuːz] writer and MIT [ˈeˈmaɪˈtiː] career counselor [ˈkaʊnsələ(r)] Lily [ˈlɪli] Zhang [tʂɑŋ] recommends [ˌrekəˈmendz] using [ˈjuːzɪŋ] a present, past, future formula [ˈfɔːmjʊlə]. Talk a little bit about your current role (including the scope [skəʊp] and perhaps one [wʌn] big accomplishment [əˈkʌmplɪʃmənt]), then give some background as [əz] to how you got there [ðeə(r)] and experience you have that’s [ˈes] relevant [ˈreləvənt]. Finally, segue [ˈseɡ] into why you want—and would be [bi] perfect for—this role.

Possible answer to “Tell me about yourself.”
“Well, I’m [em] currently [ˈkʌrəntli] an [ən] account executive [ɪɡˈzekjʊtɪv] at [ət] Smith [smɪθ], where I handle our top-performing [pəˈfɔːmɪŋ] client. Before that, I worked [ˈwɜːkt] at [ət] an [ən] agency where I was [wɒz] on [ɒn] three different major national healthcare [ˈhelθˌker] brands [brændz]. And while I really enjoyed [ɪndʒɔɪd] the work that I did, I’d love the chance to dig in [ɪn] much deeper [ˈdiːpə(r)] with one [wʌn] specific healthcare [ˈhelθˌker] company, which is why I’m [em] so [ˈsəʊ] excited [ɪkˈsaɪtɪd] about this opportunity with Metro [ˈmetrəʊ] Health Center.”

2. Walk me through your resume [rɪˈzjuːm].
Like “Tell me about yourself,” this question is a common interview opener [ˈəʊpənə(r)]. But [bʌt] instead of framing [ˈfreɪmɪŋ] your answer around what qualities [ˈkwɒlɪtɪz] and skills [skɪlz] make you best for the position, your answer should group your qualifications [ˌkwɒlɪfɪˈkeɪʃn̩z] by your past jobs [dʒɒbz] and tell your career story. You might choose to tell this story chronologically [ˌkrɒnəˈlɒdʒɪkl̩i], especially if [ɪf] there [ðeə(r)]’s [ˈes] a great anecdote [ˈænɪkdəʊt] about what set you on [ɒn] this path. Or, as [əz] with “Tell me about yourself,” you can begin with your present job then talk about what brought you here and where you’re going next. But [bʌt] regardless [rɪˈɡɑːdləs], when [wen] you speak about your “past” and “present,” highlight [ˈhaɪlaɪt] your most relevant [ˈreləvənt] experiences [ɪkˈspɪərɪənsɪz] and accomplishments [əˈkʌmplɪʃmənts] for this job and wrap up [ʌp] by talking about the future, i.e [iː]. connect your past and present together to show why this job should be [bi] the next one [wʌn] you add to your resume [rɪˈzjuːm].

Possible answer to “Walk me through your resume [rɪˈzjuːm].”
“Well, as [əz] you can see from [frəm] my [maɪ] resume [rɪˈzjuːm], I took a bit of a winding [ˈwɪndɪŋ] road to get to where I am today. In [ɪn] college, I double majored [ˈmeɪdʒəd] in [ɪn] chemistry [ˈkemɪstri] and communications [kəˌmjuːnɪˈkeɪʃn̩z]. I found early on [ɒn] that working in [ɪn] a lab all day wasn’t for me and at [ət] some point I realized [ˈrɪəlaɪzd] I looked [lʊkt] forward to the lab class I TA [tɑː]’ed [ed] the most.

“So [ˈsəʊ] when [wen] I graduated [ˈɡrædʒʊeɪtɪd], I found a job in [ɪn] sales [seɪlz] for a consumer [kənˈsjuːmə(r)] healthcare [ˈhelθˌker] products [ˈprɒdʌkts] company, where I drew on [ɒn] my [maɪ] teaching experience and learned even more about tailoring [ˈteɪlərɪŋ] your message and explaining [ɪkˈspleɪnɪŋ] complex health concepts [ˈkɒnsepts] to people without a science background. Then, I moved [muːvd] into a sales [seɪlz] training role at [ət] a massive company where I was [wɒz] responsible for teaching recent graduates [ˈɡrædʒʊeɪts] the basics [ˈbeɪsɪks] of selling [ˈselɪŋ]. My [maɪ] trainees [treɪˈniːz] on [ɒn] average had more deals [diːlz] closed in [ɪn] their first quarter than any of the other trainers [ˈtreɪnəz]’ cohorts [ˈkəʊhɔːts]. Plus, I got so [ˈsəʊ] much satisfaction from [frəm] finding the right way to train each new hire and watching [ˈwɒtʃɪŋ] them progress and succeed. It [ɪt] reminded [rɪˈmaɪndɪd] me of my [maɪ] time as [əz] a TA [tɑː] in [ɪn] college. That’s [ˈes] when [wen] I started [ˈstɑːtɪd] taking night classes [ˈklɑːsɪz] to earn my [maɪ] chemistry [ˈkemɪstri] teaching certificate [səˈtɪfɪkeɪt].

“I left my [maɪ] full-time job last year to complete my [maɪ] student teaching at [ət] P [ˈpiː].S [ˈes]. 118 in [ɪn] Manhattan [mænˈhætn̩], and over the summer, I worked [ˈwɜːkt] for a science camp, teaching kids [kɪdz] from [frəm] the ages [ˈeɪdʒɪz] of 10 to 12 about basic chemistry [ˈkemɪstri] concepts [ˈkɒnsepts] and best practices [ˈpræktɪsɪz] for safe experiments [ɪkˈsperɪmənts]. Now [naʊ], I’m [em] excited [ɪkˈsaɪtɪd] to find my [maɪ] first full-time teaching job, and your district is my [maɪ] top choice. The low student-to-teacher ratio [ˈreɪʃɪəʊ] will let me take the time to teach each student in [ɪn] the best way for them—which is my [maɪ] favorite part of the job.”

3. How did you hear about this position?
Another seemingly [ˈsiːmɪŋli] innocuous [ɪˈnɒkjʊəs] interview question, this is actually a perfect opportunity to stand out [ˈaʊt] and show your passion for and connection to the company. For example, if [ɪf] you found out [ˈaʊt] about the gig [ɡɪɡ] through a friend or professional contact, name-drop that person, then share why you were so [ˈsəʊ] excited [ɪkˈsaɪtɪd] about the job. If [ɪf] you discovered [dɪˈskʌvəd] the company through an [ən] event or article, share that. Even if [ɪf] you found the listing [ˈlɪstɪŋ] through a random job board, share what, specifically [spəˈsɪfɪkl̩i], caught your eye about the role.

Possible answer to “How did you hear about this position?”
 “I heard about an [ən] opening on [ɒn] the product team through a friend of a friend, Akiko, and since I’m [em] a big fan of your work and have been following you for a while I decided it [ɪt] would be [bi] a great role for me to apply for.”

4. Why do [duː] you want to work at [ət] this company?
Beware [bɪˈweə(r)] of generic [dʒɪˈnerɪk] answers [ˈɑːnsəz]! If [ɪf] what you say can apply to a whole slew [sluː] of other companies [ˈkʌmpənɪz], or if [ɪf] your response makes [ˈmeɪks] you sound like every other candidate [ˈkændɪdət], you’re missing an [ən] opportunity to stand out [ˈaʊt]. Zhang [tʂɑŋ] recommends [ˌrekəˈmendz] one [wʌn] of four strategies [ˈstrætədʒɪz]: Do [duː] your research and point to something that makes [ˈmeɪks] the company unique that really appeals [əˈpiːlz] to you; talk about how you’ve [ˈviː] watched [wɒtʃt] the company grow and change since you first heard of it [ɪt]; focus on [ɒn] the organization’s [ˈes] opportunities [ˌɒpəˈtjuːnɪtɪz] for future growth and how you can contribute to it [ɪt]; or share what’s [ˈes] gotten you excited [ɪkˈsaɪtɪd] from [frəm] your interactions [ˌɪntəˈrækʃn̩z] with employees [ˌemploɪˈiːz] so [ˈsəʊ] far. Whichever [wɪʧˈevə(r)] route you choose, make sure to be [bi] specific. And if [ɪf] you can’t figure out [ˈaʊt] why you’d want to work at [ət] the company you’re interviewing [ˈɪntəvjuːɪŋ] with by the time you’re well into the hiring [ˈhaɪərɪŋ] process? It [ɪt] might be [bi] a red flag telling you that this position is not [nɒt] the right fit.

Possible answer to “Why do [duː] you want to work at [ət] this company?”
“I saw on [ɒn] The Muse [mjuːz] that you were also hiring [ˈhaɪərɪŋ] for new positions [pəˈzɪʃn̩z] on [ɒn] the West Coast to support your new operations [ˌɒpəˈreɪʃn̩z] there [ðeə(r)]. I did some more reading about the new data center you’re building there [ðeə(r)] and that excites [ɪkˈsaɪts] me as [əz] I know this means [miːnz] there [ðeə(r)]’ll [laɪnz] be [bi] opportunities [ˌɒpəˈtjuːnɪtɪz] to train new teammates [ˈtiːmmeɪts]. I also learned through a Wall Street Journal article that you’re expanding [ɪkˈspændɪŋ] in [ɪn] Mexico [ˈmeksɪkəʊ] as [əz] well. I speak Spanish [ˈspænɪʃ] fluently [ˈfluːəntli] and would be [bi] eager to step up [ʌp] and help liaise [lɪˈeɪz] whenever necessary.”

5. Why do [duː] you want this job?
Again, companies [ˈkʌmpənɪz] want to hire people who are passionate about the job, so [ˈsəʊ] you should have a great answer about why you want the position. (And if [ɪf] you don’t? You probably should apply elsewhere.) First, identify a couple of key factors [ˈfæktəz] that make the role a great fit for you (e [iː].g [dʒiː]., “I love customer support because [bɪˈkɒz] I love the constant human interaction and the satisfaction that comes [kʌmz] from [frəm] helping someone solve a problem”), then share why you love the company (e [iː].g [dʒiː]., “I’ve [ˈviː] always been passionate about education, and I think you’re doing great things, so [ˈsəʊ] I want to be [bi] a part of it [ɪt]”).

Possible answer to “Why do [duː] you want this job?”
“I’ve [ˈviː] always been a fan of X [eks] Co’s [ˈes] products [ˈprɒdʌkts] and I’ve [ˈviː] spent countless [ˈkaʊntləs] hours [ˈaʊəz] playing [ˈpleɪɪŋ] your games [ɡeɪmz]. I know that your focus on [ɒn] unique stories [ˈstɔːrɪz] is what drew me and other fans [fænz] into your games [ɡeɪmz] initially [ɪˈnɪʃəli] and keeps [kiːps] us coming back for more. I’ve [ˈviː] followed [ˈfɒləʊd] X [eks] Co on [ɒn] social media for a while, and I’ve [ˈviː] always loved [ˈlʌvd] how you have people in [ɪn] different departments [dɪˈpɑːtmənts] interact with users [ˈjuːzəz]. So [ˈsəʊ] I was [wɒz] psyched [ˈsaɪkt] when [wen] I came across this posting [ˈpəʊstɪŋ] for a social media manager [ˈmænɪdʒə(r)] with TikTok experience. At [ət] my [maɪ] last job, I was [wɒz] responsible for launching [ˈlɔːntʃɪŋ] our TikTok account and growing it [ɪt] to 10,000 followers [ˈfɒləʊəz] in [ɪn] six months [mʌnθs]. Between that experience, my [maɪ] love of gaming [ˈɡeɪmɪŋ], and my [maɪ] deep knowledge of your games [ɡeɪmz] and fanbase, I know I could make this TikTok account something special and exciting.”

6. Why should we hire you?
This interview question seems [ˈsiːmz] forward (not [nɒt] to mention intimidating [ɪnˈtɪmɪdeɪtɪŋ]!), but [bʌt] if [ɪf] you’re asked [ˈɑːskt] it [ɪt], you’re in [ɪn] luck: There [ðeə(r)]’s [ˈes] no better setup [setup] for you to sell yourself and your skills [skɪlz] to the hiring [ˈhaɪərɪŋ] manager [ˈmænɪdʒə(r)]. Your job here is to craft [krɑːft] an [ən] answer that covers [ˈkʌvəz] three things: that you can not [nɒt] only do [duː] the work, but [bʌt] also deliver great results [rɪˈzʌlts]; that you’ll [laɪnz] really fit in [ɪn] with the team and culture; and that you’d be [bi] a better hire than any of the other candidates [ˈkændɪdəts].

Possible answer to “Why should we hire you?”
“I know it [ɪt]’s [ˈes] been an [ən] exciting time for General Tech [tek]—growing so [ˈsəʊ] much and acquiring [əˈkwaɪərɪŋ] several startups [ˈstɑːˌtəps]—but [bʌt] I also know from [frəm] experience that it [ɪt] can be [bi] challenging [ˈtʃæləndʒɪŋ] for the sales [seɪlz] team to understand how new products [ˈprɒdʌkts] fit in [ɪn] with the existing [ɪɡˈzɪstɪŋ] ones [wʌnz]. It [ɪt]’s [ˈes] always easier [ˈiːzɪə(r)] to sell the product you know, so [ˈsəʊ] the newer [ˈnjuːə(r)] stuff can get shortchanged [ˈʃɔːtˈtʃeɪndʒd], which can have company-wide ramifications [ˌræmɪfɪˈkeɪʃn̩z]. I have over a decade of experience as [əz] a sales [seɪlz] trainer [ˈtreɪnə(r)], but [bʌt] more importantly [ɪmˈpɔːtntli], most of those years were working with sales [seɪlz] teams [tiːmz] that were in [ɪn] the exact same boat Gen [dʒen] Tech [tek] is in [ɪn] now [naʊ]. Growth is wonderful, but [bʌt] only if [ɪf] the rest of the company can keep up [ʌp]. I’m [em] confident I can make sure your sales [seɪlz] team is confident and enthusiastic [ɪnˌθjuːzɪˈæstɪk] about selling [ˈselɪŋ] new products [ˈprɒdʌkts] by implementing [ˈɪmplɪmentɪŋ] an [ən] ongoing [ˌɒn ˈɡəʊiŋ] sales [seɪlz] training curriculum [kəˈrɪkjʊləm] that emphasizes [ˈemfəsaɪzɪz] where they sit in [ɪn] a product lineup [ˈlaɪˌnəp].”

7. What can you bring to the company?
When [wen] interviewers [ˈɪntəvjuːəz] ask this question, they don’t just want to hear about your background. They want to see that you understand what problems [ˈprɒbləmz] and challenges [ˈtʃæləndʒɪz] they’re facing as [əz] a company or department as [əz] well as [əz] how you’ll [laɪnz] fit into the existing [ɪɡˈzɪstɪŋ] organization. Read the job description closely, do [duː] your research on [ɒn] the company, and make sure you pay attention in [ɪn] your early round interviews [ˈɪntəvjuːz] to understand any issues [ˈɪʃuːz] you’re being hired [ˈhaɪəd] to solve. Then, the key is to connect your skills [skɪlz] and experiences [ɪkˈspɪərɪənsɪz] to what the company needs and share an [ən] example that shows [ʃəʊz] how you’ve [ˈviː] done similar or transferable [trænsˈfɜːrəbl̩] work in [ɪn] the past.

Possible answer to “What can you bring to the company?”
“As [əz] Jocelyn [ˈdʒɒslɪn] talked [ˈtɔːkt] about in [ɪn] our interview earlier [ˈɜːliə(r)], PopCo is looking [ˈlʊkɪŋ] to expand its market to small business owners [ˈəʊnəz] with less than 25 employees [ˌemploɪˈiːz], so [ˈsəʊ] I’d bring my [maɪ] expertise [ˌekspɜːˈtiːz] in [ɪn] this area and my [maɪ] experience in [ɪn] guiding [ˈɡaɪdɪŋ] a sales [seɪlz] team that’s [ˈes] selling [ˈselɪŋ] to these [ðiːz] customers [ˈkʌstəməz] for the first time. In [ɪn] most of my [maɪ] past roles [rəʊlz], this segment [seɡˈment] has been my [maɪ] focus and in [ɪn] my [maɪ] current role, I also played [ˈpleɪd] a big part in [ɪn] creating [kriːˈeɪtɪŋ] our sales [seɪlz] strategies [ˈstrætədʒɪz] when [wen] the business began selling [ˈselɪŋ] to these [ðiːz] customers [ˈkʌstəməz]. I worked [ˈwɜːkt] with my [maɪ] managers [ˈmænɪdʒəz] to develop the sales [seɪlz] script [skrɪpt]. I also listened [ˈlɪsn̩d] in [ɪn] on [ɒn] a number of sales [seɪlz] calls [kɔːlz] with other account execs [ˌeɡˈzeks] who were selling [ˈselɪŋ] to these [ðiːz] customers [ˈkʌstəməz] for the first time and gave them pointers [ˈpɔɪntəz] and other feedback [ˈfiːdbæk]. In [ɪn] the first quarter, our 10-person sales [seɪlz] team closed 50 new bookings [ˈbʊkɪŋz] in [ɪn] this segment [seɡˈment], and I personally closed 10 of those deals [diːlz]. I helped [helpt] guide my [maɪ] last company through the expansion [ɪkˈspænʃn̩] into small businesses [ˈbɪznəsɪz], and I’m [em] eager to do [duː] that again at [ət] PopCo. Plus, I noticed [ˈnəʊtɪst] you have a monthly [ˈmʌnθli] karaoke [ˌkæriˈəʊki] night—so [ˈsəʊ] I’m [em] eager to bring my [maɪ] rendition [renˈdɪʃn̩] of ‘Call Me Maybe’ to the team as [əz] well.”

8. What are your greatest [ˈɡreɪtɪst] strengths [streŋθs]?
Here’s [ˈes] an [ən] opening to talk about something that makes [ˈmeɪks] you great—and a great fit for this role. When [wen] you’re answering [ˈɑːnsərɪŋ] this question, think quality, not [nɒt] quantity. In [ɪn] other words [ˈwɜːdz], don’t rattle [ˈrætl̩] off a list of adjectives [ˈædʒɪktɪvz]. Instead, pick one [wʌn] or a few (depending [dɪˈpendɪŋ] on [ɒn] the question) specific qualities [ˈkwɒlɪtɪz] that are relevant [ˈreləvənt] to this position and illustrate them with examples [ɪɡˈzɑːmpl̩z]. Stories [ˈstɔːrɪz] are always more memorable [ˈmemərəbl̩] than generalizations [ˌdʒenr̩əlaɪˈzeɪʃn̩z]. And if [ɪf] there [ðeə(r)]’s [ˈes] something you were hoping [ˈhəʊpɪŋ] to mention because [bɪˈkɒz] it [ɪt] makes [ˈmeɪks] you a great candidate [ˈkændɪdət], but [bʌt] you haven [ˈheɪvn̩]’t had a chance yet, this would be [bi] the perfect time.

Possible answer to “What are your greatest [ˈɡreɪtɪst] strengths [streŋθs]?”
“I’d say one [wʌn] of my [maɪ] greatest [ˈɡreɪtɪst] strengths [streŋθs] is bringing [ˈbrɪŋɪŋ] organization to hectic [ˈhektɪk] environments [ɪnˈvaɪərənmənts] and implementing [ˈɪmplɪmentɪŋ] processes [ˈprəʊsesɪz] to make everyone’s [ˈes] lives easier [ˈiːzɪə(r)]. In [ɪn] my [maɪ] current role as [əz] an [ən] executive [ɪɡˈzekjʊtɪv] assistant [əˈsɪstənt] to a CEO [ˌsiː iːˈəʊ], I created [kriːˈeɪtɪd] new processes [ˈprəʊsesɪz] for pretty much everything, from [frəm] scheduling [ˈʃedjuːlɪŋ] meetings [ˈmiːtɪŋz] to planning [ˈplænɪŋ] monthly [ˈmʌnθli] all hands [hændz] agendas [əˈdʒendəz] to preparing [prɪˈpeərɪŋ] for event appearances [əˈpɪərənsɪz]. Everyone in [ɪn] the company knew how things worked [ˈwɜːkt] and how long they would take, and the structures [ˈstrʌktʃəz] helped [helpt] alleviate [əˈliːvieɪt] stress and set expectations [ˌekspekˈteɪʃn̩z] on [ɒn] all sides [saɪdz]. I’d be [bi] excited [ɪkˈsaɪtɪd] to bring that same approach to an [ən] operations [ˌɒpəˈreɪʃn̩z] manager [ˈmænɪdʒə(r)] role at [ət] a startup [ˈstɑːˌtəp], where everything is new and constantly growing and could use just the right amount of structure to keep things running smoothly [ˈsmuːðli].”

9. What do [duː] you consider to be [bi] your weaknesses [ˈwiːknəsɪz]?
What your interviewer [ˈɪntəvjuːə(r)] is really trying to do [duː] with this question—beyond identifying [aɪˈdentɪfaɪɪŋ] any major red flags [flæɡz]—is to gauge [ɡeɪdʒ] your self-awareness [əˈweənəs] and honesty [ˈɒnɪsti]. So [ˈsəʊ], “I can’t meet a deadline [ˈdedlaɪn] to save my [maɪ] life” is not [nɒt] an [ən] option—but [bʌt] neither is “Nothing! I’m [em] perfect!” Strike a balance by thinking of something that you struggle with but [bʌt] that you’re working to improve. For example, maybe you’ve [ˈviː] never been strong at [ət] public speaking, but [bʌt] you’ve [ˈviː] recently volunteered [ˌvɒlənˈtɪəd] to run meetings [ˈmiːtɪŋz] to help you get more comfortable when [wen] addressing [əˈdresɪŋ] a crowd.

Possible answer to “What do [duː] you consider to be [bi] your weaknesses [ˈwiːknəsɪz]?”
“It [ɪt] can be [bi] difficult for me to gauge [ɡeɪdʒ] when [wen] the people I’m [em] working with are overwhelmed [ˌəʊvəˈwelmd] or dissatisfied [dɪˈsætɪsfaɪd] with their workloads [ˈwɜːkləʊdz]. To ensure [ɪnˈʃʊə(r)] that I’m [em] not [nɒt] asking too much or too little from [frəm] my [maɪ] team, we have weekly [ˈwiːkli] check-ins [ɪnz]. I like to ask if [ɪf] they feel like they’re on [ɒn] top of their workload [ˈwɜːkləʊd], how I could better support them, whether there [ðeə(r)]’s [ˈes] anything they’d like to take on [ɒn] or get rid of, and if [ɪf] they’re engaged by what they’re doing. Even if [ɪf] the answer is ‘all good,’ these [ðiːz] meetings [ˈmiːtɪŋz] really lay the groundwork [ˈɡraʊndwɜːk] for a good and trusting [ˈtrʌstɪŋ] relationship.”

10. What is your greatest [ˈɡreɪtɪst] professional achievement?
Nothing says [ˈsez] “hire me” better than a track record of achieving [əˈtʃiːvɪŋ] amazing results [rɪˈzʌlts] in [ɪn] past jobs [dʒɒbz], so [ˈsəʊ] don’t be [bi] shy when [wen] answering [ˈɑːnsərɪŋ] this interview question! A great way to do [duː] so [ˈsəʊ] is by using [ˈjuːzɪŋ] the STAR method: situation, task, action, results [rɪˈzʌlts]. Set up [ʌp] the situation and the task that you were required to complete to provide the interviewer [ˈɪntəvjuːə(r)] with background context (e [iː].g [dʒiː]., “In [ɪn] my [maɪ] last job as [əz] a junior [ˈdʒuːnɪə(r)] analyst [ˈænəlɪst], it [ɪt] was [wɒz] my [maɪ] role to manage the invoicing [ˈɪnvoɪsɪŋ] process”), then describe what you did (the action) and what you achieved [əˈtʃiːvd] (the result): “In [ɪn] one [wʌn] month, I streamlined [ˈstriːmlaɪnd] the process, which saved [seɪvd] my [maɪ] group 10 person-hours [ˈaʊəz] each month and reduced errors [ˈerəz] on [ɒn] invoices [ˈɪnvoɪsɪz] by 25%.”

Possible answer to “What is your greatest [ˈɡreɪtɪst] professional achievement?”
“My [maɪ] greatest [ˈɡreɪtɪst] accomplishment [əˈkʌmplɪʃmənt] was [wɒz] when [wen] I helped [helpt] the street lighting company I worked [ˈwɜːkt] for convince the small town of Bend, Oregon [ˈɒrɪɡən] to convert antiquated [ˈæntɪkweɪtɪd] street lighting to energy-efficient LED bulbs [bʌlbz]. My [maɪ] role was [wɒz] created [kriːˈeɪtɪd] to promote and sell the energy-efficient bulbs [bʌlbz], while touting [ˈtaʊtɪŋ] the long-term advantage of reduced energy costs [kɒsts]. I had to develop a way to educate [ˈedʒʊkeɪt] city light officials [əˈfɪʃl̩z] on [ɒn] the value of our energy-efficient bulbs [bʌlbz]—which was [wɒz] a challenge since our products [ˈprɒdʌkts] had an [ən] expensive up [ʌp]-front cost compared [kəmˈpeəd] to less efficient lighting options [ˈɒpʃn̩z]. I created [kriːˈeɪtɪd] an [ən] information packet [ˈpækɪt] and held local community events [ɪˈvents] aimed [eɪmd] at [ət] city officials [əˈfɪʃl̩z] and the tax-paying public. There [ðeə(r)], I was [wɒz] able to demo [ˈdeməʊ] the company product, answer questions [ˈkwestʃənz], and evangelize [ɪˈvændʒəˌlaɪz] the value of LED bulbs [bʌlbz] for the long term. It [ɪt] was [wɒz] crucial [ˈkruːʃl̩] to have the public on [ɒn] board and I was [wɒz] able to reach a wide variety of community members [ˈmembəz] with these [ðiːz] events [ɪˈvents]. I not [nɒt] only reached [riːtʃt] my [maɪ] first-year sales [seɪlz] goal of $100,000, but [bʌt] I was [wɒz] also able to help us land another contract in [ɪn] a neighboring [ˈneɪbərɪŋ] city. Plus, the community-focused [ˈfəʊkəst] strategy garnered [ˈɡɑːnəd] attention from [frəm] the national media.

11. Tell me about a challenge or conflict you’ve [ˈviː] faced [feɪst] at [ət] work, and how you dealt [delt] with it [ɪt].
You’re probably not [nɒt] eager to talk about conflicts [kənˈflɪkts] you’ve [ˈviː] had at [ət] work during a job interview. But [bʌt] if [ɪf] you’re asked [ˈɑːskt] directly, don’t pretend you’ve [ˈviː] never had one [wʌn]. Be [bi] honest about a difficult situation you’ve [ˈviː] faced [feɪst] (but [bʌt] without going into the kind of detail you’d share venting [ˈventɪŋ] to a friend). “Most people who ask are only looking [ˈlʊkɪŋ] for evidence that you’re willing to face these [ðiːz] kinds [kaɪndz] of issues [ˈɪʃuːz] head-on [ɒn] and make a sincere [sɪnˈsɪə(r)] attempt at [ət] coming to a resolution,” former recruiter [rɪˈkruːtə(r)] Richard [ˈrɪtʃəd] Moy [ˌmɔɪ] says [ˈsez]. Stay calm and professional as [əz] you tell the story (and answer any follow-up [ʌp] questions [ˈkwestʃənz]), spend more time talking about the resolution than the conflict, and mention what you’d do [duː] differently next time to show “you’re open to learning from [frəm] tough experiences [ɪkˈspɪərɪənsɪz].”

Possible answer to “Tell me about a challenge or conflict you’ve [ˈviː] faced [feɪst] at [ət] work, and how you dealt [delt] with it [ɪt].”
“Funnily [ˈfʌnɪli] enough, last year I was [wɒz] part of a committee [kəˈmɪti] that put together a training on [ɒn] conflict intervention [ˌɪntəˈvenʃn̩] in [ɪn] the workplace [ˈwɜːkpleɪs] and the amount of pushback we got for requiring [rɪˈkwaɪərɪŋ] attendance [əˈtendəns] really put our training to the test. There [ðeə(r)] was [wɒz] one [wʌn] senior [ˈsiːnɪə(r)] staff member in [ɪn] particular who seemed [siːmd] adamant [ˈædəmənt]. It [ɪt] took some careful listening to understand he felt like it [ɪt] wasn’t the best use of his time given the workload [ˈwɜːkləʊd] he was [wɒz] juggling [ˈdʒʌɡl̩ɪŋ]. I made sure to acknowledge his concern. And then I focused [ˈfəʊkəst] on [ɒn] his direct objection [əbˈdʒekʃn̩] and explained [ɪkˈspleɪnd] how the training was [wɒz] meant to improve not [nɒt] just the culture of the company, but [bʌt] also the efficiency [ɪˈfɪʃnsi] at [ət] which we operated [ˈɒpəreɪtɪd]—and that the goal was [wɒz] for the training to make everyone’s [ˈes] workload [ˈwɜːkləʊd] feel lighter [ˈlaɪtə(r)]. He did eventually attend and was [wɒz] there [ðeə(r)] when [wen] I talked [ˈtɔːkt] to the whole staff about identifying [aɪˈdentɪfaɪɪŋ] the root issue of a conflict and addressing [əˈdresɪŋ] that directly without bringing [ˈbrɪŋɪŋ] in [ɪn] other issues [ˈɪʃuːz], which is how I aim to handle any disagreement [ˌdɪsəˈɡriːmənt] in [ɪn] the workplace [ˈwɜːkpleɪs].”

12. Tell me about a time you demonstrated [ˈdemənstreɪtɪd] leadership [ˈliːdəʃɪp] skills [skɪlz].
You don’t have to have a fancy title to act like a leader or demonstrate leadership [ˈliːdəʃɪp] skills [skɪlz]. Think about a time when [wen] you headed up [ʌp] a project, took the initiative [ɪˈnɪʃətɪv] to propose an [ən] alternate [ɔːlˈtɜːnət] process, or helped [helpt] motivate [ˈməʊtɪveɪt] your team to get something done. Then use the STAR method to tell your interviewer [ˈɪntəvjuːə(r)] a story, giving [ˈɡɪvɪŋ] enough detail to paint a picture (but [bʌt] not [nɒt] so [ˈsəʊ] much that you start rambling [ˈræmbl̩ɪŋ]) and making sure you spell out [ˈaʊt] the result. In [ɪn] other words [ˈwɜːdz], be [bi] clear about why you’re telling this particular story and connect all the dots [dɒts] for the interviewer [ˈɪntəvjuːə(r)].

Possible answer to “Tell me about a time you demonstrated [ˈdemənstreɪtɪd] leadership [ˈliːdəʃɪp] skills [skɪlz].”
“I think that a good leader is someone who can make decisions [dɪˈsɪʒn̩z] while also listening to others [ˈʌðəz] and being willing to admit when [wen] you’re wrong and course correct. In [ɪn] my [maɪ] last role, my [maɪ] team and I were responsible for giving [ˈɡɪvɪŋ] a big presentation [ˌpreznˈteɪʃn̩] to a prospective [prəˈspektɪv] client. I quickly assigned [əˈsaɪnd] different tasks [tɑːsks] to members [ˈmembəz] of my [maɪ] team, but [bʌt] the project never really got moving. I gave everyone an [ən] opportunity to share their input [ˈɪnpʊt] and concerns [kənˈsɜːnz], and it [ɪt] turned out [ˈaʊt] that they were struggling [ˈstrʌɡl̩ɪŋ] in [ɪn] the roles [rəʊlz] I’d given them. I ended [ˈendɪd] up [ʌp] switching [ˈswɪtʃɪŋ] a few people around. Meanwhile, the employee [ˌemploɪˈiː] I’d assigned [əˈsaɪnd] to give the presentation [ˌpreznˈteɪʃn̩] was [wɒz] nervous, but [bʌt] still wanted [ˈwɒntɪd] to give it [ɪt] a try. I worked [ˈwɜːkt] with them to make sure they were ready and even held a practice session [ˈseʃn̩] so [ˈsəʊ] that they could rehearse [rɪˈhɜːs] in [ɪn] a more comfortable environment. When [wen] the time came for the real thing, they nailed [neɪld] it [ɪt]! We landed the client and the company still has the account to this day. And that employee [ˌemploɪˈiː] became a go-to person for important client presentations [ˌpreznˈteɪʃn̩z]. I’m [em] really glad I took the time to listen to everyone’s [ˈes] concerns [kənˈsɜːnz] so [ˈsəʊ] that I could re-evaluate [ɪˈvæljʊeɪt] my [maɪ] approach and help my [maɪ] team be [bi] the best it [ɪt] could be [bi].”

13. What’s [ˈes] a time you disagreed [ˌdɪsəˈɡriːd] with a decision that was [wɒz] made at [ət] work?
The ideal anecdote [ˈænɪkdəʊt] here is one [wʌn] where you handled [ˈhændl̩d] a disagreement [ˌdɪsəˈɡriːmənt] professionally [prəˈfeʃnəli] and learned something from [frəm] the experience. Zhang [tʂɑŋ] recommends [ˌrekəˈmendz] paying particular attention to how you start and end your response. To open, make a short statement to frame the rest of your answer, one [wʌn] that nods [nɒdz] at [ət] the ultimate takeaway [ˈteɪkəweɪ] or the reason you’re telling this story. For example: “I learned early on [ɒn] in [ɪn] my [maɪ] professional career that it [ɪt]’s [ˈes] fine to disagree [ˌdɪsəˈɡriː] if [ɪf] you can back up [ʌp] your hunches [ˈhʌntʃɪz] with data.” And to close strong, you can either give a one [wʌn]-sentence summary [ˈsʌməri] of your answer (“In [ɪn] short…”) or talk briefly about how what you learned or gained [ɡeɪnd] from [frəm] this experience would help you in [ɪn] the role you’re interviewing [ˈɪntəvjuːɪŋ] for.

Possible answer to “What’s [ˈes] a time you disagreed [ˌdɪsəˈɡriːd] with a decision that was [wɒz] made at [ət] work?”
“In [ɪn] my [maɪ] job as [əz] a finance [ˈfaɪnæns] assistant [əˈsɪstənt], I was [wɒz] in [ɪn] charge of putting together reports [rɪˈpɔːts] for potential company investments [ɪnˈvestmənts]. It [ɪt] was [wɒz] important to get the details [ˈdiːteɪlz] and numbers [ˈnʌmbəz] right so [ˈsəʊ] that leaders [ˈliːdəz] had the best information to make a decision. One [wʌn] time, my [maɪ] boss [bɒs] asked [ˈɑːskt] me to generate a new report on [ɒn] a Wednesday [ˈwenzdeɪ] morning and wanted [ˈwɒntɪd] it [ɪt] done by Thursday [ˈθɜːzdeɪ] at [ət] 5 PM [ˌpiːˈem]. Because [bɪˈkɒz] I’m [em] committed [kəˈmɪtɪd] to high-quality work and I wasn’t sure my [maɪ] boss [bɒs] fully understood what goes [ɡəʊz] into each report, I knew I needed [ˈniːdɪd] to speak up [ʌp]. At [ət] her next available opening, I sat down with my [maɪ] boss [bɒs] and explained [ɪkˈspleɪnd] my [maɪ] concerns [kənˈsɜːnz]. She was [wɒz] firm that the report would be [bi] completed [kəmˈpliːtɪd] by Thursday [ˈθɜːzdeɪ] at [ət] 5 PM [ˌpiːˈem]. So [ˈsəʊ] I decided to ask if [ɪf] there [ðeə(r)] was [wɒz] anyone who could help out [ˈaʊt]. After thinking about it [ɪt], my [maɪ] boss [bɒs] found another assistant [əˈsɪstənt] who could put in [ɪn] a few hours [ˈaʊəz]. While it [ɪt] was [wɒz] a tight timeline [ˈtaɪmlaɪn], we got the report done, and the committee [kəˈmɪti] was [wɒz] really pleased [pliːzd] to review it [ɪt] at [ət] the meeting. My [maɪ] boss [bɒs] appreciated [əˈpriːʃieɪtɪd] my [maɪ] extra efforts [ˈefəts] to make it [ɪt] happen and I felt good that I hadn’t let the quality of the report slip. It [ɪt] was [wɒz] a good experience of being a team player but [bʌt] also knowing when [wen] and how to ask for help. And once I explained [ɪkˈspleɪnd] how much time and work goes [ɡəʊz] into each report, my [maɪ] boss [bɒs] was [wɒz] careful to assign [əˈsaɪn] them further in [ɪn] advance.”

14. Tell me about a time you made a mistake.
You’re probably not [nɒt] too eager to dig into past blunders [ˈblʌndəz] when [wen] you’re trying to impress an [ən] interviewer [ˈɪntəvjuːə(r)] and land a job. But [bʌt] talking about a mistake and winning someone over aren [ˈɑːən]’t mutually [ˈmjuːtʃʊəli] exclusive [ɪkˈskluːsɪv], Moy [ˌmɔɪ] says [ˈsez]. In [ɪn] fact, if [ɪf] you do [duː] it [ɪt] right, it [ɪt] can help you. The key is to be [bi] honest without placing [ˈpleɪsɪŋ] blame on [ɒn] other people, then explain what you learned from [frəm] your mistake and what actions [ˈækʃn̩z] you took to ensure [ɪnˈʃʊə(r)] it [ɪt] didn’t happen again. At [ət] the end of the day, employers [ɪmˈploɪəz] are looking [ˈlʊkɪŋ] for folks [fəʊks] who are self-aware, can take feedback [ˈfiːdbæk], and care about doing better.

Possible answer to “Tell me about a time you made a mistake.”
“Early in [ɪn] my [maɪ] career, I missed [mɪst] a deadline [ˈdedlaɪn] that ended [ˈendɪd] up [ʌp] costing [ˈkɒstɪŋ] us a really big account. There [ðeə(r)] were a lot of factors [ˈfæktəz] that contributed [kənˈtrɪbjuːtɪd] to this, but [bʌt] ultimately, I was [wɒz] the one [wʌn] who dropped [drɒpt] the ball. From [frəm] that experience, I went back and thought really hard about what I could’ve [ˈviː] controlled [kənˈtrəʊld] and what I would’ve [ˈviː] changed [tʃeɪndʒd]. It [ɪt] turns [tɜːnz] out [ˈaʊt] that I was [wɒz] not [nɒt] nearly as [əz] organized as [əz] I thought I was [wɒz]. I sat down with my [maɪ] boss [bɒs], asked [ˈɑːskt] for suggestions [səˈdʒestʃənz] on [ɒn] how to improve my [maɪ] organizational [ˌɔːɡənaɪˈzeɪʃnl̩] skills [skɪlz], and a few months [mʌnθs] later I was [wɒz] able to score an [ən] even bigger [ˈbɪɡə(r)] account for the department.”

15. Tell me about a time you failed [feɪld].
This question is very similar to the one [wʌn] about making a mistake, and you should approach your answer in [ɪn] much the same way. Make sure you pick a real, actual failure you can speak honestly [ˈɒnɪstli] about. Start by making it [ɪt] clear to the interviewer [ˈɪntəvjuːə(r)] how you define failure. For instance: “As [əz] a manager [ˈmænɪdʒə(r)], I consider it [ɪt] a failure whenever I’m [em] caught by surprise. I strive [straɪv] to know what’s [ˈes] going on [ɒn] with my [maɪ] team and their work.” Then situate [ˈsɪtʃueɪt] your story in [ɪn] relation to that definition and explain what happened [ˈhæpənd]. Finally, don’t forget to share what you learned. It [ɪt]’s [ˈes] OK [ˌəʊˈkeɪ] to fail—everyone does [dʌz] sometimes—but [bʌt] it [ɪt]’s [ˈes] important to show that you took something from [frəm] the experience.

Possible answer to “Tell me about a time you failed [feɪld].”
“As [əz] a team manager [ˈmænɪdʒə(r)], I consider it [ɪt] a failure if [ɪf] I don’t know what’s [ˈes] going on [ɒn] with my [maɪ] staff and their work—basically if [ɪf] a problem catches [ˈkætʃɪz] me by surprise then I’ve [ˈviː] failed [feɪld] somewhere along the way. Even if [ɪf] the outcome is ultimately fine, it [ɪt] means [miːnz] I’ve [ˈviː] left a team member unsupported [ˌʌnsəˈpɔːtɪd] at [ət] some point. A somewhat recent example would be [bi] this training we do [duː] every year for new project managers [ˈmænɪdʒəz]. Because [bɪˈkɒz] it [ɪt]’s [ˈes] an [ən] event that my [maɪ] team has run so [ˈsəʊ] many times [ˈtaɪmz], I didn’t think to check in [ɪn] and had no idea a scheduling [ˈʃedjuːlɪŋ] conflict was [wɒz] brewing [ˈbruːɪŋ] into a full-on [ɒn] turf [tɜːf] war with another team. The resolution actually ended [ˈendɪd] up [ʌp] being a quick and easy conversation at [ət] the leadership [ˈliːdəʃɪp] team meeting, but [bʌt] had I just asked [ˈɑːskt] about it [ɪt] sooner [ˈsuːnə(r)] it [ɪt] would never have been a problem to begin with. I definitely [ˈdefɪnətli] learned my [maɪ] lesson about setting reminders [rɪˈmaɪndəz] to check in [ɪn] about major projects [prəˈdʒekts] or events [ɪˈvents] even if [ɪf] they’ve [ˈviː] been done dozens [ˈdʌzn̩z] of times [ˈtaɪmz] before.”

16. Why are you leaving [ˈliːvɪŋ] your current job?
This is a toughie [ˈtʌfi], but [bʌt] one [wʌn] you can be [bi] sure you’ll [laɪnz] be [bi] asked [ˈɑːskt]. Definitely [ˈdefɪnətli] keep things positive—you have nothing to gain by being negative about your current employer [ɪmˈploɪə(r)]. Instead, frame things in [ɪn] a way that shows [ʃəʊz] that you’re eager to take on [ɒn] new opportunities [ˌɒpəˈtjuːnɪtɪz] and that the role you’re interviewing [ˈɪntəvjuːɪŋ] for is a better fit for you. For example, “I’d really love to be [bi] part of product development from [frəm] beginning to end, and I know I’d have that opportunity here.” And if [ɪf] you were let go from [frəm] your most recent job? Keep it [ɪt] simple: “Unfortunately [ʌnˈfɔːtʃʊnətli], I was [wɒz] let go,” is a totally [ˈtəʊtəli] acceptable [əkˈseptəbl̩] answer.

Possible answer to “Why are you leaving [ˈliːvɪŋ] your current job?”
“I’m [em] ready for the next challenge in [ɪn] my [maɪ] career. I loved [ˈlʌvd] the people I worked [ˈwɜːkt] with and the projects [prəˈdʒekts] I worked [ˈwɜːkt] on [ɒn], but [bʌt] at [ət] some point I realized [ˈrɪəlaɪzd] I wasn’t being challenged [ˈtʃæləndʒd] the way I used to be [bi]. Rather than let myself get too comfortable, I decided to pursue a position where I can continue to grow.”

17. Why were you fired [ˈfaɪəd]?
Of course, they may ask the follow-up [ʌp] question: Why were you let go? If [ɪf] you lost your job due to layoffs [ˈleɪˌɒfs], you can simply say, “The company [reorganized [riːˈɔːɡənaɪzd]/merged [mɜːdʒd]/was [wɒz] acquired [əˈkwaɪəd]] and unfortunately [ʌnˈfɔːtʃʊnətli] my [maɪ] [position/department] was [wɒz] eliminated [ɪˈlɪmɪneɪtɪd].” But [bʌt] what if [ɪf] you were fired [ˈfaɪəd] for performance reasons [ˈriːzənz]? Your best bet is to be [bi] honest (the job-seeking [ˈsiːkɪŋ] world is small, after all). But [bʌt] it [ɪt] doesn’t have to be [bi] a deal breaker [ˈbreɪkə(r)]. Frame it [ɪt] as [əz] a learning experience: Share how you’ve [ˈviː] grown and how you approach your job and life now [naʊ] as [əz] a result. And if [ɪf] you can portray [pɔːˈtreɪ] your growth as [əz] an [ən] advantage for this next job, even better.

Possible answer to “Why were you fired [ˈfaɪəd]?”
“After working for XYZ Inc [ɪŋk]. for four years, there [ðeə(r)] were some changes [ˈtʃeɪndʒɪz] made to the amount of client calls [kɔːlz] we were expected [ɪkˈspektɪd] to process per hour. I used the techniques [tekˈniːks] we were taught after the change took effect, but [bʌt] didn’t want our customer service to slip. Unfortunately [ʌnˈfɔːtʃʊnətli], I wasn’t consistently [kənˈsɪstəntli] completing [kəmˈpliːtɪŋ] the required number of calls [kɔːlz], and, as [əz] a result, I was [wɒz] let go. I felt really bad about this and in [ɪn] retrospect [ˈretrəspekt] I could have done better sticking [ˈstɪkɪŋ] to the process that would have let me meet the per hour quota [ˈkwəʊtə]. But [bʌt] you’ve [ˈviː] told me about the customer service standards [ˈstændədz] and the volume expectations [ˌekspekˈteɪʃn̩z] here, and I believe it [ɪt] won’t be [bi] a problem.”

18. Why was [wɒz] there [ðeə(r)] a gap in [ɪn] your employment [ɪmˈploɪmənt]?
Maybe you were taking care of children or aging [ˈeɪdʒɪŋ] parents [ˈpeərənts], dealing with health issues [ˈɪʃuːz], or traveling [ˈtrævəlɪŋ] the world. Maybe it [ɪt] just took you a long time to land the right job. Whatever the reason, you should be [bi] prepared to discuss the gap (or gaps [ɡæps]) on [ɒn] your resume [rɪˈzjuːm]. Seriously [ˈsɪərɪəsli], practice saying your answer out [ˈaʊt] loud. The key is to be [bi] honest, though that doesn’t mean you have to share more details [ˈdiːteɪlz] than you’re comfortable with. If [ɪf] there [ðeə(r)] are skills [skɪlz] or qualities [ˈkwɒlɪtɪz] you honed [həʊnd] or gained [ɡeɪnd] in [ɪn] your time away from [frəm] the workforce [ˈwɜːkfɔːs]—whether through volunteer work, running a home, or responding [rɪˈspɒndɪŋ] to a personal crisis—you can also talk about how those would help you excel [ɪkˈsel] in [ɪn] this role.

Possible answer to “Why was [wɒz] there [ðeə(r)] a gap in [ɪn] your employment [ɪmˈploɪmənt]?”
“I spent a number of years working at [ət] a company in [ɪn] a very demanding [dɪˈmɑːndɪŋ] job, in [ɪn] which—as [əz] you’ll [laɪnz] see from [frəm] my [maɪ] references [ˈrefrənsɪz]—I was [wɒz] very successful. But [bʌt] I’d reached [riːtʃt] a stage in [ɪn] my [maɪ] career where I wanted [ˈwɒntɪd] to focus on [ɒn] my [maɪ] personal growth. The time I spent traveling [ˈtrævəlɪŋ] taught me a lot about how to get along with people of all ages [ˈeɪdʒɪz] and cultures [ˈkʌltʃəz]. Now [naʊ] I feel more than ready to jump back into my [maɪ] career with renewed [rɪˈnjuːd] energy and focus and I feel this role is the ideal way to do [duː] that.”

19. Can you explain why you changed [tʃeɪndʒd] career paths [pɑːðz]?
Don’t be [bi] thrown off by this question—just take a deep breath and explain to the hiring [ˈhaɪərɪŋ] manager [ˈmænɪdʒə(r)] why you’ve [ˈviː] made the career decisions [dɪˈsɪʒn̩z] you have. More importantly [ɪmˈpɔːtntli], give a few examples [ɪɡˈzɑːmpl̩z] of how your past experience is transferable [trænsˈfɜːrəbl̩] to the new role. This doesn’t have to be [bi] a direct connection; in [ɪn] fact, it [ɪt]’s [ˈes] often more impressive when [wen] a candidate [ˈkændɪdət] can show how seemingly [ˈsiːmɪŋli] irrelevant [ɪˈreləvənt] experience is very relevant [ˈreləvənt] to the role.

Possible answer to “Can you explain why you changed [tʃeɪndʒd] career paths [pɑːðz]?”
“Ever since my [maɪ] brother was [wɒz] diagnosed [ˈdaɪəɡnəʊzd] with a heart condition, I’ve [ˈviː] been training and running with him in [ɪn] your annual [ˈænjuəl] Heart Run to raise money for your organization and help support patients [ˈpeɪʃnts] with expenses [ɪkˈspensɪz] not [nɒt] covered by insurance [ɪnˈʃʊərəns].

So [ˈsəʊ] when [wen] I saw this posting [ˈpəʊstɪŋ] for a fundraising [ˈfənˌdresɪŋ] role, it [ɪt] felt like it [ɪt] was [wɒz] meant to be [bi]. For the last 10 years of my [maɪ] career I’ve [ˈviː] been an [ən] account executive [ɪɡˈzekjʊtɪv] for various SaaS companies [ˈkʌmpənɪz], and I’ve [ˈviː] really honed [həʊnd] my [maɪ] skills [skɪlz] when [wen] it [ɪt] comes [kʌmz] to convincing [kənˈvɪnsɪŋ] organizations [ˌɔːɡənaɪˈzeɪʃn̩z] to make regular payments [ˈpeɪmənts] for something over the long-term.
