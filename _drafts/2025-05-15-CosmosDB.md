What is CosmosDB?  What has it matters?
When ask you do you know CosmosDB for instance or something else what is it mean
I dont know code of CosmosDB as 
but I can know  a client which call CosmosDB 
May be it sound strange but in reality  it is very concrete things
From this point of view I can say what I know CosmosDb  sufficiently good
 if I understand props, methods and scenarios of Package "Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos"
 Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos has other dependency  
all this staff are located in  https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-dotnet-v3.git

Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB.ChangeFeedProcessor"
Bulk operation
Azure function
How create db Container


src repo
D:\src\AZURE

Idea to send data as json and to query by Sql like syntax

install explorer
1. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer#layout-container-uid0e8a
path `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer`

2.install cosmos emulator https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/emulator

my path `C:\Program Files\Azure Cosmos DB Emulator`

run  powershell with admin right 
```
—Åd "C:\Program Files\Azure Cosmos DB Emulator"
./Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Emulator.exe /Port=63123
```
All data will be  created locally. I don't need cosmosDb account if I have emulator NoSQL API.

It needs to wait when Chrome will be automatically opened
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/emulator-windows-arguments#manage-the-emulator-with-command-line-syntax

After I logined in Azure https://portal.azure.com/#home 
the browser opened https://localhost:63123/_explorer/index.html

data  in page  https://localhost:63123/_explorer/index.html

```
url localhost:8081
primary key
connection string
mongo connection string
```
I will use for connection  to run `Quickstart` app.  src D:\src\AZURE\DocumentDB-Quickstart-DotNetCore


then  go to  `D:\src\AZURE\azure-cosmos-dotnet-v3\scratch.md`

check sample. 
D:\src\AZURE\azure-cosmos-dotnet-v3\Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples\Usage
check tests only if it required. I am not sure it needs really.
D:\src\AZURE\azure-cosmos-dotnet-v3\Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos\tests
