All of a sudden I quit lighting matches, and sort of leaned nearer to her over the 
table. I had quite a few topics on my mind. "Hey, Sally," I said. 

"What?" she said. She was looking at some girl on the other side of the room. 

"Did you ever get fed up?" I said. "I mean did you ever get scared that everything 
was going to go lousy unless you did something? I mean do you like school, and all that 
stuff?" 

"It's a terrific bore." 

"I mean do you hate it? I know it's a terrific bore, but do you hate it, is what I 

mean." 

"Well, I don’t exactly hate it. You always have to—" 

"Well, I hate it. Boy, do I hate it," I said. "But it isn’t just that. It's everything. I 
hate living in New York and all. Taxicabs, and Madison Avenue buses, with the drivers 
and all always yelling at you to get out at the rear door, and being introduced to phony 
guys that call the Lunts angels, and going up and down in elevators when you just want to 
go outside, and guys fitting your pants all the time at Brooks, and people always—" 

"Don’t shout, please," old Sally said. Which was very funny, because I wasn’t 
even shouting. 

"Take cars," I said. I said it in this very quiet voice. "Take most people, they're 
crazy about cars. They worry if they get a little scratch on them, and they’re always 
talking about how many miles they get to a gallon, and if they get a brand-new car 
already they start thinking about trading it in for one that's even newer. I don’t even like 
old cars. I mean they don't even interest me. I’d rather have a goddam horse. A horse is at 
least human, for God's sake. A horse you can at least—" 

"I don’t know what you're even talking about," old Sally said. "You jump from 

one—" 

"You know something?" I said. "You're probably the only reason I'm in New 
York right now, or anywhere. If you weren’t around, I'd probably be someplace way the 
hell off. In the woods or some goddam place. You're the only reason I'm around, 
practically." 

"You're sweet," she said. But you could tell she wanted me to change the damn 

subject. 

"You ought to go to a boys' school sometime. Try it sometime," I said. "It's full of 
phonies, and all you do is study so that you can learn enough to be smart enough to be 
able to buy a goddam Cadillac some day, and you have to keep making believe you give 
a damn if the football team loses, and all you do is talk about girls and liquor and sex all 
day, and everybody sticks together in these dirty little goddam cliques. The guys that are 
on the basketball team stick together, the Catholics stick together, the goddam 


intellectuals stick together, the guys that play bridge stick together. Even the guys that 
belong to the goddam Book-of-the-Month Club stick together. If you try to have a little 
intelligent—" 

"Now, listen," old Sally said. "Lots of boys get more out of school than that." 

"I agree! I agree they do, some of them! But that's all I get out of it. See? That’s 
my point. That's exactly my goddam point," I said. "I don't get hardly anything out of 
anything. I'm in bad shape. I'm in lousy shape." 

"You certainly are." 

Then, all of a sudden, I got this idea. 

"Look," I said. "Here's my idea. How would you like to get the hell out of here? 
Here's my idea. I know this guy down in Greenwich Village that we can borrow his car 
for a couple of weeks. He used to go to the same school I did and he still owes me ten 
bucks. What we could do is, tomorrow morning we could drive up to Massachusetts and 
Vermont, and all around there, see. It's beautiful as hell up there, It really is." I was 
getting excited as hell, the more I thought of it, and I sort of reached over and took old 
Sally's goddam hand. What a goddam fool I was. "No kidding," I said. "I have about a 
hundred and eighty bucks in the bank. I can take it out when it opens in the morning, and 
then I could go down and get this guy's car. No kidding. We'll stay in these cabin camps 
and stuff like that till the dough runs out. Then, when the dough runs out, I could get a 
job somewhere and we could live somewhere with a brook and all and, later on, we could 
get married or something. I could chop all our own wood in the wintertime and all. 
Honest to God, we could have a terrific time! Wuddaya say? C’mon! Wuddaya say? Will 
you do it with me? Please!" 

"You can't just do something like that," old Sally said. She sounded sore as hell. 

"Why not? Why the hell not?" 

"Stop screaming at me, please," she said. Which was crap, because I wasn't even 
screaming at her. 

"Why can'tcha? Why not?" 

"Because you can't, that's all. In the first place, we’re both practically children. 
And did you ever stop to think what you'd do if you didn't get a job when your money ran 
out? We’d starve to death. The whole thing's so fantastic, it isn’t even—" 

"It isn’t fantastic. I’d get a job. Don’t worry about that. You don’t have to worry 
about that. What's the matter? Don’t you want to go with me? Say so, if you don’t." 

"It isn't that. It isn’t that at all," old Sally said. I was beginning to hate her, in a 
way. "We’ll have oodles of time to do those things— all those things. I mean after you go 
to college and all, and if we should get married and all. There’ll be oodles of marvelous 
places to go to. You're just— " 

"No, there wouldn’t be. There wouldn’t be oodles of places to go to at all. It’d be 
entirely different," I said. I was getting depressed as hell again. 

"What?" she said. "I can't hear you. One minute you scream at me, and the next 

you—" 

"I said no, there wouldn’t be marvelous places to go to after I went to college and 
all. Open your ears. It’d be entirely different. We’d have to go downstairs in elevators 
with suitcases and stuff. We’d have to phone up everybody and tell ’em good-by and send 
’em postcards from hotels and all. And I’d be working in some office, making a lot of 
dough, and riding to work in cabs and Madison Avenue buses, and reading newspapers,
