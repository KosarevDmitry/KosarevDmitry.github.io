There is a tutorial on the `jekyll` website, presented on several pages.
In the process of working with it, I came up with a script that seems to me more visual and easier to understand.  
Code is too long to post in page here. See [tutorial.sh](/assets/attachment/tutorial.sh)
```bash
# https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/
#inside the site root folder

# Gemfile is a equivalent of package.json for Ruby

bundle init # to create Gemfile
echo gem \"jekyll\" >> Gemfile   # add Jekyll package

# Bundler is a gem that installs all gems in your Gemfile.
# https://bundler.io/v2.4/man/bundle-install.1.html

bundle install   #   to fetch. Gemfile.lock file will be created in current src dir.

bundle info jekyll # check version and  path installation just in case


mkdir _layouts # && cd "$_"
# about syntax {{page.title}} see https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/

cat > $_/default.html << EOF
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>{{page.title}}</title>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    {% include navigation.html %}
    {{ content }}
  </body>
</html>
EOF


```
