There is a tutorial on the `jekyll` website, presented on several pages.
In the process of working with it, I came up with a script that seems to me more visual and easier to understand.

```bash
# https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/
#inside the site root folder

# Gemfile is a equivalent of package.json for Ruby
# to create Gemfile
bundle init
# add Jekyll package
echo gem \"jekyll\" >> Gemfile  

# Bundler is a gem that installs all gems in your Gemfile.
# https://bundler.io/v2.4/man/bundle-install.1.html
# to create  Gemfile.lock
bundle install  

# just in case check version and  path installation 
bundle info jekyll
```
