There is a tutorial on the `jekyll` website, presented on several pages.
In the process of working with it, I came up with a script that seems to me more visual and easier to understand.  
Code is too long to post in page here. See <https://gist.github.com/KosarevDmitry/606ded5edd97886c6428e8825e2b886b>
