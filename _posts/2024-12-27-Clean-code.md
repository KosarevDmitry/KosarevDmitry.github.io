There is no such thing as `clean  code` - it's a myth. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.

This reminds me of Cyril Northcote Parkinson's preface on the wise choice of statesmen "Do not think that we want to discourage the inquisitive from learned books about business and administrative life...".
I am in this topic too. You save, then destroy them en masse, I know what these certificates, instructions, orders and words are worth.

Let's get back to programming. My opinion.

The code was born in someone's head, then something came out, maybe it remained on the stand, drafts, in the process of explaining to yourself and your comrades.
It was more or less clear when the code was written, when I explained it to the testers. Then no one was interested in it. The creator-creator moved on.

If it is so `clean code`, why do they comment on it for years, publish books, plus courses, posts, everyone in their own way, mamamia.
