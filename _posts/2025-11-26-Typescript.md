For a more stable understanding, to expand one's consciousness, so to speak, because reading the code is not very difficult, but to understand it more closely, one should still do so, to understand what we are talking about in general, what kind of things there can be.

All you need  

1. To check that `tsc` CLI is installed
2. Run `tsc --help` just in case. It is an usual approach.
3. Download  https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Website.git, open `.\packages\documentation\copy\en\referene` and	read  markdown files. 
4. Create project `mkdir test && cd test && tsc --init && echo null > test.ts`
3. Insert any snippet from reference to  file.
4  Run `tsc` . New js file will be created. 

This way  you understand code deeply than just reading.   
 
Pecular recommendations about appropriate  config settings I can not give.  Problems are resolved as they arise.
At least `target`, `module` are  certainly important.
