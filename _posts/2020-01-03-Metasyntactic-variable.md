It is necessary to use them because they simplify the understanding of the examples.  
Everything that is not important for the compilator, are not keywords, is better to name it this way.    
There is  the wikipedia [article] on this topic.  

**List of words**
```
foobar, foo, bar, baz, tata,   
titi, tutu fuga, qux, quux,   
corge, grault, garply, waldo,  
fred, plugh, xyzzy, thud;
```
Although other short words also are suitable for example- fee, boo, loo, koo. Why not?  
But itâ€™s still preferable to add tags `<username>`, `<host>` ets.
