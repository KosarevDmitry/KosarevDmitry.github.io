Suppose I forked a repo  for study, then I write a post in which I want to provide a link to the source, and not to my repo.
In order to see the repo address on the local computer, I usually open the `/.git/config` file.
It is faster than doing `git config remote.origin url`    
But .git folder does not contains the information where the repo is forked from.  
That is, you will have to add it manually. 

You can do it this way:  

`git config --add core.forkedfrom  https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/sql-docs.git`    

But it's probably  more naturally by   

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/....git` or   
`git remote add fork https://github.com/....git`
