The idea is to find out what file name extensions are used.
By names I mean  the  last name section started with uppercase char.

Look at what happened 
[NameExtensionStatistics.txt](/assets/NameExtensionStatistics.txt)

This is script
<script src="https://gist.github.com/KosarevDmitry/6ce12b67652c2814d3eb20f1b4bf22da.js"></script>

And then to find out there are any  differences  between files  by their purpose: Provider vs Builder vs Factory. I haven't done this yet
