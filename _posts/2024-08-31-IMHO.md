Microsoft opinion in 2012 г.  
WARNING: This post goes deep into an advanced area of .NET that most developers never need to think about.  

The personal opinion of the a good programmer   

- 2012

ExecutionContext is one of those things that the vast majority of developers **never need to think about**. It’s kind of like air:
it’s important that it’s there, but except at some crucial times (e.g. when something goes wrong with it), we don’t think about
it being there. ExecutionContext is actually just a container for other contexts. Some of these other contexts are ancillary,
while some are vital to the execution model of .NET, but they all follow the same philosophy I described for
ExecutionContext:** if you have to know they’re there, either you’re doing something super advanced, or something’s gone
wrong**.

While it’s common to use this support without knowing exactly what’s happening under the hood, 
I’m a firm believer that understanding how something actually works helps you to make even better use of it.
